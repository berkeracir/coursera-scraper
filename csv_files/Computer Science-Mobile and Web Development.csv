Build an App in Android Studio using Read-Write,https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-an-app-in-android-studio-using-read-write,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,Ken Cotter,"In this project you will build an Android app that creates text files in internal storage when needed, will write to those files, and will read from those files.  The app will also interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app). This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with ""Read Review"" on it, and the second with ""Submit Review"" on it.  When the user clicks the ""Read Review"" button a TextView will appear containing a the previously submitted review (if one exists). The user will also be given the option to ""Submit Review"" whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a ""Submit"" button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. When launched the app will also read all information in the review files in internal storage and bring the reviews into the app for use. You will upload an APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io to test the app.

Python Dynamic HTML Web Server,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-dynamic-html-web-server,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,David Dalsveen,"Web application servers are abundant these days. Each have one thing in common, they ultimately process requests and return web pages. Apache serves PHP pages along with static HTML. Microsoft’s .NET creates dynamic web pages that may be authored using C# or VB and served using IIS. Java Enterprise Edition has many options, WebSphere, WebLogic, and Apache TomEE to name a few server platforms. 
Python has its own web server that can be built in one line of code, but it is relatively simple to create the server code yourself. This is useful if you want to understand how web servers work and can be used to quickly test your own web pages. In addition, some browsers will not load local files due to security; using a simple web server solves this issue as well.

In this course, you will create a Python application in which you will create a simple HTTP server, create a static web page, create dynamic pages using python, and access the pages from the server using the command line as well as from a browser.
