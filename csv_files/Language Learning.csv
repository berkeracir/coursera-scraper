¿Siente curiosidad acerca de las variaciones española y argentina o americana del Español estudiadas en textos cultos de referencia? En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián entre el centeno», españolas.
Las Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones que ha merecido el curso.

En este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones de G. V. Higgins; y por las variedades peninsular y argentina o americana de la lengua española en las diferentes versiones de J.D. Salinger.

La finalidad del curso es doble. 
Ante un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. 
Y, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. 

Finalizar este curso le permitirá: 
1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores españoles. 
2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), 
3. Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto», versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). 

Estos dos últimos objetivos tiene más valor por dos motivos: 
•	Los textos de observación cumplen, sin duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana, o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir lo dicho en el texto fuente.
•	Las versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’, desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua. 

No es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de algunas manifestaciones de la variedad argentina y española de lengua.",109182.0,32881.0,4.6,1401.0

The course structure is the same for all learners and there are opportunities for them to link up with colleagues from universities all over the world who share the same discipline and discourse community, to ask questions and exchange ideas.
This MOOC targets lecturers who wish to begin using English in their teaching. A priori, this means university lecturers from countries where English is not the L1 or a widely-used language (Romance language-speaking countries, for example), though in fact the course is open to teachers from all educational stages who want to teach through English, following the principles of EMI (English Medium Instruction).

On completing the course, you should be able to do the following.

a) Teach a university subject in English, having gained the necessary confidence and skills.
 
b) Integrate all aspects of CLIL (methodological, pedagogical, strategic, attitudinal, motivational, linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic) to put together their own English-medium course on their particular subject.

c) Describe the characteristics of the university lecture discourse genre (planning, agents, channels, phases, dynamics, and current flexibility of the genre).

d) Understand and perform the basic linguistic macro-functions within English teaching discourse.

e) Understand and perform, using the appropriate linguistic exponents (vocabulary, structures, and phraseology), the main micro-functions in English teaching discourse: metalinguistic, informative, evaluative, inductive, and social.

f) Consolidate their oral expression and interaction skills, and their grammar and vocabulary, at English levels C1 and C2 as defined by the Council of Europe.

Successful Interviewing,https://www.coursera.org/learn/successful-interviewing,Language Learning,Learning English,"Charles Duquette, Daniela C. Wagner-Loera","The goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. It’s to hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that’s involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do a job and they’ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work and they’ll work for their passion.

And this is not a case of “fake it until you make it.” You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the company, and the position – and be able to show how your goals in life align with the company’s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you demonstrate that you’re the right candidate for the job.

This course is the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1, #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing - can be taken in any sequence, while course #5 is the capstone for the specialization as a whole.

This course can be thought of as ""Interviewing I"", while course #3 is ""Interviewing II.""  Course #3 covers more advanced interview formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process, involve all the skills that you'll learn from course #1 through course #3.

As for this course, it will teach you how to:

1.	Do thorough research on a company of your choice.

2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).

3.     Prepare for the all important ""Tell Me About Yourself"" question.

4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.

5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.

6.	Prepare an elevator speech - all three variations.

7.	Use persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.

8.	Use persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.

9.	Adapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers.",45543.0,21264.0,4.6,159.0
