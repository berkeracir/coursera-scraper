Greek and Roman Mythology,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mythology,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Peter Struck,"Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

COURSE SCHEDULE
 
• Week 1: Introduction 
Welcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define ""myth""? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.
Readings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game. 
Video Lectures: 1.1-1.7 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.

• Week 2: Becoming a Hero 
In week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.
Readings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 
Video Lectures: 2.1-2.10 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back 
This week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, ""man of twists and turns,"" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.
Readings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 
Video Lectures: 3.1-3.10 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 4: Identity and Signs 
As he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.
Readings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 
Video Lectures: 4.1-4.8 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 5: Gods and Humans 
We will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or ""birth of the gods,"" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.
Readings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* 
Video Lectures: 5.1-5.9 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 6: Ritual and Religion 
This week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.
Readings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) 
Video Lectures: 6.1-6.7
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 7: Justice 
What counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.
Readings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides 
Video Lectures: 7.1-7.10 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 8: Unstable Selves
This week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.
Readings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae 
Video Lectures: 8.1-8.9
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade 
Moving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.
Readings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 
Video Lectures: 9.1-9.10 
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.
 
• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses 
Our consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who ""remythologize,"" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.
Readings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. 
Video Lectures: 10.1-10.9.
Quiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.

Intellectual Humility: Practice,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-humility-practice,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"Dr. Ian Church, Professor Duncan Pritchard, Dr. Emma Gordon","We live in a polarised world where all too often people talk past each other. But do you know when to believe what others say? For example, how quick should we be to accept something that someone else tells us is true, and what should we be looking out for when assessing a person's trustworthiness? Meanwhile, what should we do when we encounter disagreements with people who seem to be our equals? How and when should we adjust our beliefs, and how does the appropriate response vary depending on the evidence? These challenges may be especially important in the arena of religious disagreements. How should we weigh the evidence for and against various theistic and atheistic stances?

Experts in psychology, philosophy, theology and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it’s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.

In this course. we will examine the following major questions about applied issues surrounding intellectual humility:
 
•         Should you believe what people say?
•         How should we handle disagreement?
•         What is the role of evidence in resolving religious disagreements?
 
All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life. 

This course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. Before, we considered how to define and measure intellectual humility, what intellectual virtue is, whether we are born or can become humble, and what cognition and emotions can tell us about intellectual humility.

But how do we develop this virtue? And why do so many people still end up so arrogant? Do our own biases hold us back from becoming as intellectually humble as we could be—and are there some biases that actually make us more likely to be humble? Which cognitive dispositions and personality traits give people an edge at being more intellectually humble - and are they stable from birth, learned habits, or something in between?

Anybody who either has an interest in Korean culture, maybe through K-Dramas or K-pop, or an interest in philosophy from a cross-cultural perspective, are all welcome.

Despite the growing interest in Korean culture, there are few courses which explore the fascinating topic of Korean philosophy. On this course, you’ll be introduced to concepts in Korean philosophy through an exploration of the Korean language, culture and perspective.
The Korean cultural, social, and political environment has informed and transformed the intellectual assets of China and the West. You’ll explore the creative tensions that Koreans have experienced, and broaden your worldview as you discover a new philosophical approach.",10113.0,12954.0,4.9,134.0

Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. 

Topics you’ll learn about will include: 

Epistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;

Philosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;

Philosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;

Political Philosophy, where we'll investigate whether we have an obligation to obey the law;

Moral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;

Metaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about free will and the nature of reality.

Introduction to Religions & Ecology,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-religions-ecology,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim","At first glance the fields of religion and ecology may seem and unlikely pairing, but a deeper consideration reveals the two have a great deal to contribute to one another and are indeed inextricably linked. Religions recognize the unity and interdependence of humans with nature. Ecological sciences affirm this deep interconnection with the natural world. This partnership can inspire work for the wellbeing of the Earth community 

There is a need for broader literacy and deeper knowledge of the world’s religions and their ecological contributions. This specialization, starting with this course, contributes such a perspective. Each course celebrates the vitality of religiously-informed action for the Earth and recognizes the longstanding contributions of Indigenous peoples in offering visions and practices for ecological flourishing. 

This course is part one of the ""Religions and Ecology: Restoring the Earth Community"" series of classes that focuses on the ecological dimensions of religious traditions throughout the world. The course you are about to begin is designed as a gateway to the other classes. It describes the nature of religion as well as the emergence of the field of ecology. In addition, it highlights concerns for forestry issues, the climate emergency, global ethics, and environmental justice.

This course is for lifelong learners curious to know more about world religions and ecology, environmental professionals eager to deepen the discourse of environmental protection and conservation, those working with non-profit organizations and NGOs on issues of ecological justice, and religion leaders and laity who wish to know how they can contribute to interreligious dialogue on environmental projects.",2548.0,5856.0,4.9,35.0
Know Thyself - The Value and Limits of Self-Knowledge: The Examined Life,https://www.coursera.org/learn/know-thyself-the-examined-life,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"Mitchell Green, Dr Simon Fokt","According to legend, inscribed on walls of the temple on the sacred site of Delphi in Ancient Greece were two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.

Learning Outcomes: 
Learners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves. In the course of doing so, they will gain an appreciation of the relation of self-knowledge to wisdom, of the value of intellectual humility, as well as of methods of learning about oneself that do not depend on introspection. 

Learners will also become familiar with contemporary research in experimental social psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience into the emotions, the unconscious, the role of affect in decision making, and self-deception. They will also gain an appreciation of a challenge to the assumption of a coherent, unified self that derives from the Buddhist tradition.

Know Thyself - The Value and Limits of Self-Knowledge: The Unconscious,https://www.coursera.org/learn/know-thyself-the-unconscious,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Mitchell Green,"A challenging but fascinating topic on the way to achieving self-knowledge is the unconscious. For well over a century, psychologists, philosophers, and many others have posited a level of mentality that is not immediately open to introspection; some would even say that certain unconscious elements cannot be known through introspection. This course will examine some of the most influential ideas about the unconscious starting with the work of Sigmund Freud, and follow the development of theories of the unconscious all the way to present research in experimental psychology. But be warned: some of the things you may learn about your unconscious mind may be surprising, and possibly even disturbing!

"Le Bien, le Juste, l'Utile. Introduction aux éthiques philosophiques",https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethique,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"François Dermange, Ghislain Waterlot","Course in French with English and Chinese subtitles

Ce cours présente les principaux courants qui marquent aujourd'hui la réflexion éthique et touchent tout un chacun dans sa vie personnelle, sociale et citoyenne. D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.

Notre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.
C’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.

Quels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.

About this course:

This course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: ""do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others"". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.

Love as a Force for Social Justice,https://www.coursera.org/learn/love-social-justice,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Anne Firth Murray,"The objectives of this course are:

-To introduce participants to different concepts of love, to empower them to be conscious of the power of love and the possibility of practicing it in everyday life, and to highlight in particular the idea of love as a force for social justice.

-To communicate a sense of personal strength and empowerment by actively learning from each other and beginning to define how participants can apply their learning in service to society.

This course will explore the concept of agape love (compassion/kindness) as a force for social justice and action and as the inspiration for service and the application of knowledge to positive social change. Biological, psychological, religious, and social perspectives of love will be discussed, drawing on the expertise of people from a variety of disciplines. 

During the six-week course, the following topics will be raised and discussed: kinds of love/defining love; non-violent communication; love and the biology of the brain; love as a basic concept of religious and ethical beliefs (e.g., Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Gandhian); love applied in action, and poetic expressions of love as a social force. This curriculum aims to foster a sense of the importance of love as a key phenomenon in creating community, connection, and functional societies among humans.

Course materials will draw from a variety of sources. One of the goals of the class is to provide participants with some knowledge of the literature of love, and readings for the course are listed in the outline of the course on the pages that follow.",33165.0,16090.0,4.7,376.0
Luther and the West,https://www.coursera.org/learn/luther-and-the-west,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Christine Helmer,"In this course we will discuss the history of some ideas that have been hugely influential in the modern west and that were taken out to the rest of the world. The discussion centers on an extraordinary and historically important figure, a sixteenth century German man named Martin Luther. Luther is recognized today as the originator of many of the most significant ideas that continue to affect and shape who we as modern people are and how we see the world and ourselves for better and for worse.

In the first section, we will explore why Luther thought the Bible was the most important volume for everyone to have and read. Included here will be a careful consideration of Luther's anti-Judaism, which contributed to western antisemitism and some of the greatest horrors of the twentieth century.

In the second section, we will talk about the idea of freedom and how Luther's understanding of freedom in Christ affected the way modern thinkers understood what it means to be human in community. Important in this section is the consequential contradiction between freedom and slavery in western thought and their co-existence in western societies.

The third section will be all about the many complicated relations between religion and politics.

Meditation: A way to achieve your goals in your life,https://www.coursera.org/learn/self-reflection-meditation,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Duck-Joo Lee,"Do we truly think that we have lived for ourselves? Perhaps we have lived for money, love, fame, family and pride etc.? Therefore, we don’t seem to be satisfied even though we are full of those things. It is because that we don’t know ourselves.

Eric Fromm talked about human nature as two modes of being: “To Have” and “To Be”.  If we are “Having” the nature of possessions, we are not satisfied, and feel empty and futile. Then, how can we be “Being” the nature of our inner-selves?

Sometimes, we happened to be aware of this “Being” nature and try to change ourselves, but fail. But, because of our daily routines, it’s easily forgotten. And more it is hard to escape from our unwanted minds controlling us.

From now on, let us reflect on ourselves and look at our minds leading up to today! Don’t we achieve our goals after knowing ourselves? And let us find the “Being” nature of our original selves after escaping from the minds restraining and controlling us.

In this lecture, the definition and principle of the mind are explained in simple and clear ways. You can make sure and practice the methodology of finding the true original mind of inner-self by escaping from the false mind of possession. 

Self-reflection is the first step to meditate. You can know yourselves most objectively through meditation and you will realize that all the thoughts and actions are due to your minds which are nonexistent and false. If you throw away the false mind, you will find the true mind.

Meditation is now world-wide sensation. There are many research reports that show people can be leaders if you have a habit of self-reflection through meditation. Now meditation at school and the workplace are popular.

Happiness is having no worries. You can really relax yourself if there is no bundle of thoughts and you can be successful when you know yourself truly. Worries come from the memorized thoughts of the false mind. Your inner potential of positive power are revealed, your peaceful and happiest mind will be in your mind, and you can live the life you wanted through meditation.

This method of meditation is very practical and everybody can follow the methodology. As an engineer, I will guide you step by step to practice this meditation. I am sure that this lecture becomes a turning point in your life.",88642.0,28831.0,4.6,934.0
Mind of the Universe - Genetic Privacy: should we be concerned?,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mind-of-the-universe-genetic-privacy,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"Lotte Pet, Robert Zwijnenberg","Should all our genetic information be made public in order to eradicate genetic diseases from this world?

Who owns your genetic data once it becomes publicly accessible? What is your responsibility to family members when you know more about genetic diseases than they do? Who decides what kind of genetic information is relevant to a person? And what does genetic privacy mean to you?

In this challenge with Robert Zwijnenberg (Professor in Art and Science Interactions) you will critically reflect upon the issue of genetic privacy. You will dive into the ethical questions that come up with the disclosure of genetic data in biobanks and through genetic tests. This course encourages you to think about the cultural, philosophical and political tensions present in the debate around genetic privacy. You are invited to identify and listen to the viewpoints and values provided by the different stakeholders that shape this debate: corporations, researchers, consumers and patients. Furthermore, you will go off the beaten track by exploring the issue from the unique perspective of art and culture. After a lot of thinking, supplementing, deleting and adjusting, you will be asked to share a recommendation on how to regulate practices of disclosing genetic information, while taking into consideration the concept of genetic privacy. Your advice could serve as an eye-opener for policy makers!

Mind of the Universe: Science in Progress,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mind-of-the-universe-science-in-progress,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Tim De Mey,"From William Harvey discovering the circulation of blood to Albert Einstein developing the theory of relativity: almost all scientific research starts from something odd and unexpected that hasn't been explained yet, and, subsequently, the scientist creatively imagining possible explanations for it, formulating hypotheses.

However, the problem with formulating hypotheses is the ""theory-ladenness of observation"": ones expectations and background theories curtail and determine what one observes. The best way to reduce the negative consequences of theory-ladenness of observation as much as possible, is not by adopting the highest methodological standards, but by continuing to think outside the box throughout the problem solving process, by tirelessly, creatively imagining alternative explanations and hypotheses.

In this learning experience you will be turned upside down by philosopher Tim de Mey, who will challenge you to think outside of your comfort zone. You will be challenged to reflect critically and creatively on what triggers your research, i.e., what is driving the scientist in you. Tim will show you how openness to and interaction with other disciplines generates new ideas, and how important it is that scientists, besides the possibilities of their own discipline, are also aware of its (and there) limitations. Take this challenge and you will construct the perfect out-of-the-box research question that will tease the Mind of the Universe scientists to explore even better answers in their research.

•  Does current cognitive science of religion effectively explain away God?
•  If there is a God who has made us so that we can know him, why do some people not believe?
•  Is belief in science also a kind of fundamentalism?
•  What makes us good at getting, giving, or sharing, knowledge? Is this different when it is religious knowledge?

Reality Bites: Introduction to metaphysics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/metaphysics,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Tim De Mey,"Speculative metaphysics is challenging, but this course will whet your appetite for it, because it explains fundamental metaphysical problems and views in terms of what you can find in your kitchen and what happens in it when you cook and enjoy food. Here are the 8 bites on the menu.

- The first module 1 explains that metaphysics is about the ingredients and recipes of the world, i.e., which kinds of entities exist and how they relate to one another.
- Modules 2 and 3 invite you to reflect on whether the properties of ingredients -such as their shape and weight- are separate from and if so, how they come together in the ingredients.
- Modules 4 to 7 are about cooking: its most important ingredient is time and most cooking consists in causing changes to the ingredients over time. Yet  some ingredients persist: although they undergo changes, they remain the same. Moreover, cooking minimally involves putting two or more ingredients together, so that they compose a whole. Hence modules 4 to 7 deal with time, causation, persistence and composition respectively.
- Finally, the last module touch on the smells, tastes and other qualitative aspects of our experiences when enjoying food.

Reason and Persuasion: Thinking Through Three Dialogues By Plato,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plato-dialogues,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"John Holbo, Associate Professor","In this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - ""Euthyphro"", ""Meno"", ""Republic"" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. 

Platonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.

We have a book: the new 4th edition of ""Reason and Persuasion"", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) 

The book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.

The course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. 

The results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.

Plato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before. I wouldn't presume to dictate more exactly.",34082.0,5317.0,4.5,278.0
Reasoning Across the Disciplines,https://www.coursera.org/learn/critical-reasoning,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Dr. Ram  Neta,"Critical reasoning skills are a key success factor for students entering their first year of college. They must be able to think logically and form arguments. This course, designed with incoming college freshmen in mind but open to anyone, provides an essential grounding in critical reasoning skills. Faculty from multiple disciplines at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offer guidance on applying critical thinking skills in the context of specific disciplines. By developing these skills, students will learn more, enjoy their courses more, and experience greater academic success.

This course will help you understand what critical thinking skills are and why they're so important. You will also learn how critical thinking skills vary across disciplines, as well as see them applied across several fields, including, chemistry, history, psychology, law, English, and American Studies. You will develop your own critical thinking skills by working through scenarios or problems posed by scholars across these fields, and you will better understand how your college courses will differ from your earlier education.",13860.0,5805.0,4.3,56.0
Relativism,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relativism,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Annalisa Coliva,"Relativism is an ancient philosophical doctrine which has recurred time and again in the history of philosophy. It has also transcended the boundaries of that discipline, for it has shaped much of the methodology in anthropology and sociology, as well as in critical theory and literary studies. While often advocated for its supposed tolerance of differences, relativism has profound consequences for how we think of reality, for the possibility of knowledge, both in the factual and in the moral domain, and may engender the practice of double standard. 

If a wind is hot for me and cold for you and none of us is at fault, does this mean that reality is always perspectival, or that it admits of contradictory descriptions? If a belief turns out to be justified when evaluated within a certain epistemic system (such as religion, for instance), while it turns out to be unjustified if assessed from within a different one (science, say), does relativism undermine the very possibility of knowledge? If an action can be morally permissible within an ethical system and not so within a different one, does that challenge the idea that there are moral truths and moral progress? These are some of the questions we will engage in during the course, while considering examples taken from the history of science, such as the Bellarmine-Galileo dispute, and from everyday life.

This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about philosophy, along with those who are looking for strategies to combat extremism in their communities. Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.

In this course, learners will:

Explore the concept of Relativism

Science & Religion 101,https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-and-religion-101,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Denis Lamoureux,"This course examines the nature of both science and religion and attempts to explore the possible relationships between them. The primary purpose is to dispel the popular myth that science and religion are entrenched in a never-ending conflict. As a result, this course argues that if the limits of both science and religion are respected, then their relationship can be complementary.

Topics include: Science and Religion Categories and Foundational Principles, Definitions of Science and Religion, Science-Religion Models and Relationships, Intelligent Design and Natural Revelation, the Galileo Affair, Geology and Noah’s Flood, Evolution and Darwin’s Religious Beliefs, the Modern “Evolution” vs. “Creation” Debate, the Problem of Evil, and Interpretations of the Biblical Accounts of Origins in Genesis 1-11.

The course employs a Constructive Teaching Style in order that students can develop their personal views on the relationship between science and religion and on each of the topics listed above.

Skepticism,https://www.coursera.org/learn/skepticism,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Professor Duncan Pritchard,"Skepticism is about doubt, and doubt is everywhere in the world around us today. There are doubts about whether man-made climate change is real, whether vaccinations are harmful, whether we can trust our politicians or our media, and so on. When is such skepticism warranted, and when does it stray into unreasonable territory? How widespread can such skepticism get while still being coherent? How might a radical skepticism have pernicious social consequences, such as by leading to relativism (and just what is relativism, and what is problematic about it)? 

These are all questions that we will be engaging with in this course Along the way we will consider some important philosophical issues, such as what the nature of knowledge is, whether there are any good arguments that show that knowledge is impossible, and how a moderate skepticism might accord with an ancient conception of the good life of human flourishing, one that essentially involves the intellectual virtues.

"Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity",https://www.coursera.org/learn/kierkegaard,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,"Jon Stewart, PhD, Dr theol & phil","It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity. 

The Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.

In this course created by former associate professor at the Søren Kierkegaard Research Centre, Jon Stewart, we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.",54690.0,12862.0,4.8,688.0
The Epistemic Quest for Truth: Introduction to epistemology,https://www.coursera.org/learn/epistemology,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Tim De Mey,"The introduction of the internet and of social media has drastically changed our information position. We live in a time of ‘truth decay’: the distinction between opinions and facts is blurred, opinions have more impact than facts, and sources of factual information are increasingly distrusted. Since philosophers love truth, they deplore these tendencies. But what can they do about them?

In this course, you will be invited to reflect on whether, in what sense and to what extent, 2500 years of normative epistemology, or theory of knowledge, can be put into practice and help to reduce truth decay. You’ll be invited, more specifically, to reflect on
- the theory of knowledge,
- the analysis of knowledge,
- the possibility of knowledge,
- the structure of knowledge,
- the kinds of knowledge, and
- the value of knowledge.

Thought Experiments: An introduction to philosophy,https://www.coursera.org/learn/thought-experiments,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,Tim De Mey,"Doing philosophy is like seeing a movie and wondering what will happen next, or what you would do in the same situation, or what’s real and what’s merely make-believe.

You’re probably not aware of it, but since you already know how to see movies and use your imagination, you’re well on your way to becoming a good philosopher. The only thing you still need and want to develop though, is the ability to use your imagination in the philosophical way, and that’s exactly what you’ll learn in this MOOC.

Firstly, you’ll learn how to use your imagination to put definitions, analyses or conceptions of philosophically relevant notions to the test by means of imaginary examples and counterexamples, addressing questions that have been part and parcel of Western philosophy since its very inception, such as 
- ‘what is knowledge?’;
- ‘what is the mind?’;
- ’what is moral responsibility?’; and
- ‘what is justice?’.

Subsequently, you’ll learn how to use your imagination to develop your worldview. You’ll learn to speculate about what might explain your experiences, ranging from the commonsense explanation in terms of a mind-independent world, to sceptical alternatives, such as that you’re systematically misled by an evil demon or that only your mind exists and that it confabulates all the rest.

Finally, since philosophy is not only about interpreting the world, but also about changing it -and hopefully, for the better- you’ll also learn how to use your imagination to evaluate what the right thing to do is in a given situation, what the criteria are to evaluate actions, and whether such criteria are established evermore or remain an open question.",2499.0,7270.0,,

This MOOC teaches you to develop accountable, high-quality and ethical responses to disaster in conflict-affected areas. The E-course is meant primarily for practitioners, but also open to students or otherwise interested people. It stimulates participants to think about humanitarian aid, DRR and disaster response in contexts where conflict is ongoing, lingering, or has characterized the setting in recent times, as well as about the hard choices and dilemmas faced by humanitarian actors in conflict settings. Moreover, you will learn to distinguish the different challenges and effective, positive examples of aid in three types of conflict settings.

悖论：思维的魔方,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bei-lun,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,陈波,"“悖论”（paradox）指思维中深层次的矛盾，并且是难解的矛盾。它们是巨大且艰深的理智难题，以触目惊心的形式向我们展示了：我们的看似合理、有效的“共识”、“前提”、“推理规则”在某些地方出了问题，我们思维中最基本的概念、原理、原则在某些地方潜藏着风险。悖论对人类理智构成严重挑战，并在人类的认知发展和科学发展中起重要作用。

本课程将讲授历史上已经提出的一些著名悖论，涉及的论题有：一些扰人的二难困境；模糊性：连锁悖论；芝诺悖论和无穷之迷；逻辑-数学悖论；语义悖论；休谟问题和归纳悖论；认知悖论；合理行动和决策的悖论；道德悖论；中国古代文化中的悖论；对于悖论的进一步思考，如此等等。

我认为，大学里应该传授两类知识：一类知识“实实在在”，另一类知识“奇奇怪怪”。

学习第一类知识后，你能够成为此类知识的使用者和传播者，成为社会所需要的合格的劳动者，能够直接在企事业单位就业，也为自己谋一份体面而有尊严的生活。

学习第二类知识，则有助于打破你的思维定势，开拓你的理智空间，激发你的理智好奇心，使你养成独立思考的习惯，培养一种健康、温和的怀疑主义态度，培养一种宽容和接纳的文明态度，能够成为民主社会中独立自主、理性负责的公民，经进一步深造后，有可能成为知识的创造者和生产者，成为各行各业中的精英人物。

“悖论”（paradox）典型地属于“奇奇怪怪”的知识。",6647.0,5635.0,4.8,36.0

莊子─人情 (Zhuangzi─Between People),https://www.coursera.org/learn/zhuangzi2,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,蔡璧名,"　　「我很想從七歲起就跟你一起長大。」這是我今生聽過最美的情話。

年過五十的今天，我把今生聽過最美的情話，輕輕對莊子說。

        彼時迷途，求學阡陌縱使規矩昭然，卻沒有一條路能看見遠方。
        那年錯愛，蹉跎青春，只換來心碎。此刻紅塵，被職場的權力關係層層綑綁，動輒得咎。
        多少次，我們種瓜卻不得瓜，給愛卻不被愛，理直卻更難容身！
        置身人間世，要如何才能心身無傷、全身而退？

〈人間世〉幫助我們及早看清，並籌謀對策

        上回，《莊子．逍遙遊》提出人生目標的設定，〈齊物論〉傳授如何泯除分別、平息攪擾的齊物攻略，〈養生主〉兼括身體技術、心靈工夫與用情原則的養生大要。這回，莊子帶領讀者親臨現場，面對複雜紛擾的人情，不復完好、支離破碎的世界，儒家的至聖與亞聖說：我們可以選擇逃離（「危邦不入，亂邦不居」、「是故知命者，不立乎巖牆之下」）；莊子卻鼓勵我們熱情擁抱，當拯濟天下的大醫（「治國去之，亂國就之。醫門多疾」）。但這艱難的醫國行為，並非汲汲朝外奔走，而是從徹底療癒、強化自我心身開始──須先確立自己，才有能力樹立別人。〈人間世〉的七則小故事，無論是討論事君之道或處亂世之方，在在都寄寓了莊子學說最重要的心靈功課。能夠做到心情靜定，再佐以傳話、勸諫的原則以及人際網絡中的應對進退之方，才有機會達成溝通、教化的目的。
        莊子並帶我們深刻反思，是否因過於重視世俗價值的「有用」，竟忽略更根本、重要的心與身？倘能由保全心身的立場，從「人，才是目的」的角度出發，便可發現看似「無用」、不幸的遭遇，其「大用」、幸運所在。

〈德充符〉提供的情傷疫苗與用情典範

        〈德充符〉得見多位樹立一己之餘，已然可以帶給眾人美好影響的人。莊子先講了三個迷人男子的故事，他們正好有共通的心靈特質──明白事物本來就會遷化。他們不是放棄一切，而是放下成見，而注意、看重那隱藏在萬物生滅變化、離合聚散後的永恆存在¬¬──生命最根本、最重要的心靈。
        莊子再舉三位男主角的例子，他們雖然沒有權位、財富、學識，且相貌奇醜，但是為什麼受歡迎呢？原來，人活天地間最重要的才能，是在與外界交流溝通時心靈能不因此失去平和、喜樂。原來，人與人之間，最讓你想親近對方的理由，是性情、是精神、是心。都說，人在江湖。莊子卻說，人能自由。活在一人之力難以操控的人間世，只有心靈，經由不斷陶養、不斷進步是可以絕對自主的。一個心靈能維持平靜安和，德性又不彰顯於外的人，萬物都想與他親近，難以離開。
        愛情不難。愛對人，最難。像是愛他、又好像不是。心動，就該行動了嗎？究竟該繼續緊握這雙手？還是該毫不留戀地往前走？──莊子陶養你看人的眼光，點出：沒有器量，就沒有體諒。什麼樣的對待值得偕行一程？什麼樣的人值得共度一生？──莊子說，是情深似海、愛厚如洋。原來相愛最關鍵的元素，是精神、是靈魂。
        想愛，卻愛得傷神，隨他而去的心要如何追回？凋零的人要如何回春？──莊子提供一系列情傷急救設備，有「不以好惡內傷」疫苗、「用心若鏡」OK繃、「安之若命」止血劑、「心齋神凝」葉克膜，供君取用。

        有一種處人魅力，不慍不執，愛而無傷。
        有一種處世智慧，不卑不亢，勇於不敢。
        寂寞幽昧的人生，幸有莊子偕行。

        世界夠黑，人才懂得：可以把心點亮。
        情傷太重，人才甘願：學習補強此心。
        職場乏了，你才想聽：怎樣溝通才能不累？
        寂寞幽昧的旅程，恰是選擇開啟閉鎖已久心門、重拾滿室輝光的契機。
        遠路才是近路。絕處才易逢春。
        正是時候，讀《莊子》。

本課程之學習目標，主要可以概括以下三點： 
一、經由代表性作品的選讀，使學生對中國的人文傳統有深一層的認識。 
二、經由對經典性文獻的研討分析過程，使學生熟悉人文思維的程序與方法。 
三、經由寫作練習，一方面增長學生的思考以及文字的表達能力，一方面促進學生對於一己生命的自覺，而導向成熟人生觀的建立。",6357.0,4076.0,5.0,44.0
"莊子─姿勢、意識與感情 (Zhuangzi─Posture, Awareness, and Sentiment)",https://www.coursera.org/learn/zhuangzi,Arts and Humanities,Philosophy,蔡璧名,"　　他這麼活過他的一生，留下一本書，《莊子》。這本書影響了陶淵明的一生，影響了李太白的一生，影響了白居易的一生，影響了蘇東坡的一生。唐玄宗下詔稱此書為《南華真經》，尊莊子為南華真人。清初名評論家金聖歎，評定這本書是「天下第一才子書」。

才子必讀，欲成才者必讀。如果你醉心於技進於道、技道合一的職人文化，追本溯源，請讀《莊子》。如果你不想成材、不想在優勝劣敗的競走中疲憊一生，也請讀《莊子》。如果想處於才與不才之間、想在人生的驚濤駭浪間存活、無傷，更錬就日益精進的乘御之力，就請打開《莊子》。

　「福輕乎羽，莫之知載。禍重乎地，莫之知避。」（《莊子．人間世》）

　　莊子所處的戰國時代，平民百姓能擁有的福份比羽毛還要輕薄，飄忽不定不知道要怎樣才能承接、擁有；可是災難禍患卻比山河大地還要沈重，想要閃避卻不知道有什麼方法能全身而退。當時，一次戰爭裡被斬首、殺害的士卒多達數萬、數十萬人。

　　而莊子，就在這麼個布滿羅網、暗藏凶器的時代社會裏，擔任一個小小漆樹園的，小小吏。

　　必須承受、最能感受時代之傷的，莫過於金字塔底層。
　　是戰國中期的莊子，也是當代的你我。
　　蕭條異代都同樣湧動著如風浪翻滾、層出不窮的普世之傷。

　　與莊子為友，在李白之後、東坡之後，在詩人、哲人、職人與成千上萬因此改變姿勢、意識與用情的人們之後，本季課程將陪你逐字逐句讀完莊子親筆內七篇中的前三篇〈逍遙遊〉、〈齊物論〉、〈養生主〉，而莊周在此中斷續鋪陳、輻輳的三個主題：姿勢、意識與感情，也將在逐字逐句的講解中豁然胸次。──你會發現，原來只要把注意力收回自身，心就可以不煩、不亂、不痛。原來只要掌握正確的姿勢原則，身體竟可以如此輕靈放鬆。原來感情可以不執著、不陷溺，只要懂得深情而不滯於情。原來身心的安定，是面對混亂的時代最有力量的武器。

　　時局板蕩，曖昧天光，半部《論語》治天下，半部《莊子》治身心，正是時候，好好讀《莊子》。

　　為使聽者易於掌握《莊》學大旨，將〈逍遙遊〉、〈齊物論〉、〈養生主〉各分為三、五、五章，各章下依長度略分小節；並設計體驗古典單元，使能活用於日常。",16186.0,10394.0,4.8,185.0
