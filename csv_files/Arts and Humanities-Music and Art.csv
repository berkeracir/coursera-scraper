20世纪西方音乐 Western Music in the 20th Century,https://www.coursera.org/learn/20cnwm,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,毕明辉 Bryan Minghui BI,"课程所涉不仅涵盖古典音乐如新古典主义、表现主义、民族主义等流派，也对爵士乐、摇滚乐与流行音乐在20世纪的风格情状投以深切关注；在将包括中国音乐在内的世界各国民族民间音乐纳入20世纪大背景予以研究探索之同时，关于大型综合艺术品例如歌剧、音乐剧、电影音乐的考察与分析，也设为专题，绝无偏废。

课程以20世纪西方音乐为主体内容，在清晰贯穿历史线索和侧重史观发展之同时，尤为强调音乐聆听能力的培养，增进音乐知识的积累，凸显理论与实践相结合的开课理念。什么是音乐、什么是20世纪西方音乐、什么是有效聆听成为全课核心知识支柱，引导学生探查关于20世纪西方音乐的三种聆听模式，以期对关于20世纪西方音乐文化诸多现象形成多视角、多维度、多方法、多接口的认识与理解，从而为学生开拓眼界、触类旁通、多学科交叉、创造力之发展，完美人格之形成，提供实际而扎实的服务。

This course was first offered at Peking University in 2008 as a Public Elective Course, and subsequently as a Course for General Education. It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University’s MOOCs. 

Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",4066.0,2484.0,4.4,42.0

A tecnologia da produção musical,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tecnologia-producao-musical,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Loudon Stearns,"Aprenda sobre o processo de produção musical (inclusive sobre gravação, edição e mixagem) e conheça as ferramentas disponíveis para criação de música contemporânea no computador.

Devido à recente disponibilidade de softwares e hardwares de alta qualidade e baixo custo, agora as ferramentas de produção musical estão ao alcance de todos. Os álbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estúdios, agora também são criados em quartos. À primeira vista, isso é libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um álbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se você for mais a fundo, verá que não é tão fácil assim. É preciso conhecimento, dedicação e criatividade para produzir música.
    
Fornecer conhecimento é o propósito deste curso. Não importa o tipo de música que você está produzindo, há um grande conjunto de ferramentas que você precisará usar.  Cada lição deste curso demonstrará um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produção musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produção musical de gravar, editar e mixar. 

Vamos começar com algumas noções sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessários para gravar áudio em um computador, para que você compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produção musical. 
    
Depois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como edição. A edição nos permite dar a impressão de execuções perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na música contemporânea. A ferramenta de edição contemporânea é a estação de trabalho de áudio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de edição que são essenciais na produção de música contemporânea e que são fornecidas por todas as DAWs. 

Após a edição, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se você souber usá-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades básicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserções, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som também deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da música. Vamos analisar a compressão, a equalização e o retardo, além de examinar os muitos efeitos de áudio que são extensões desses dispositivos e como eles são usados em um contexto musical.
    
No fim das contas, o processo de produção musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade é um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, até que as ferramentas certas são usadas da maneira certa para compartilhá-la com o mundo. Se você tem uma ideia em mente, precisará passar por inúmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu público. Traga a dedicação e criatividade para este curso, que ele fornecerá o conhecimento para fazer acontecer.",3094.0,3382.0,4.9,34.0
ART of the MOOC: Activism and Social Movements,https://www.coursera.org/learn/activism-social-movements,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Nato Thompson, Pedro Lasch","This course is for activists, artists, and thinkers who wish to better understand and participate in social change. We will focus on the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Rather than assess the political efficacy of activities like mourning, listening, organizing, dancing, or partying, the lectures examine such cultural activities next to, and within, contemporary art practice. 

Included in the course are guest presentations by key artists, activists, and scholars, like: Rebecca Gomperts, Chido Govera, Gulf Labor, Hans Haacke, Sharon Hayes, Jolene Rickard, Gregory Sholette, Joshua Wong, and many more. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch and co-taught by Creative Time artistic director, Nato Thompson, the course challenges learners to treat the MOOC itself as a social and artistic form. This happens mostly through the practical components, local project productions, global exchanges, and critical feedback.

While no prior art making or activist experience is required, projects also offer challenging options for advanced learners.

Accessibility to the Scenic Arts,https://www.coursera.org/learn/accessibility-scenic-arts,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Pilar Orero, Sharon Black, Anna Matamala","Is your show accessible?

When we ask about accessibility to shows, most people think about access for wheel chairs: the sitting arrangements and where their WC is accessible.
When we ask for more details, people usually think about producing a show where persons with disabilities are performing, for example producing a show where there is some dancing with people on wheel chairs.
Accessiblity for us is a comprehensive concept that goes from purchasing a ticket through an accessible website to catching the bus back home after the performance on accessible public transport. Accessible webs, accessible web content, accessible transport, subtitling, audio description... the possiblities are endless.
Why is this course useful? 
To make the venue and the production accessible to all citizens, and specially to persons with disablities. The course will go through the many accessible services you can offer, and how to implement them in your venue or your production. The final aim is to mainstream accessibility so all people have equal access to culture.",2343.0,4637.0,4.7,29.0

Approaching Music Theory: Melodic Forms and Simple Harmony,https://www.coursera.org/learn/melodic-forms-simple-harmony,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Marc Lowenstein,"This course is about how music works. It is about the relationship between the technical and aesthetic details of music. It is also about how developing a meaningful theoretical vocabulary can help you think and talk about musical style, and how learning that vocabulary can expand your appreciation for music.

In this course you will learn music theory not by looking at theory itself, but by listening to, looking at, and—yes!—writing your own musical examples. By hearing, seeing, and writing yourself, you will learn about classical, modern, ancient, pop, jazz, and folk styles.

Through lectures, relevant examples, and numerous practice assignments, we will examine fundamental aspects of melody. We will move into working with two voices and counterpoint, and finally to three voices and the beginnings of harmonic function.

This is an intermediate-level course for musicians and composers who already have some understanding of music theory through previous study. If you are a musician or composer looking to build a deeper understanding of music theory for composing, performing, or improvisation, you have come to the right place. If you are an amateur lover of music or, perhaps, play a musical instrument and want to develop a deeper sense of appreciation for music theory, aesthetics, and history, you are also in the right place!",38738.0,31690.0,4.7,139.0

Asian Environmental Humanities: Landscapes in Transition,https://www.coursera.org/learn/asian-environmental-humanities,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Andrea Riemenschnitter,"In this course, featuring many researchers from the University of Zurich and international institutions, we will introduce you to some of the most vibrant cultural trends addressing landscape appreciation, degradation, protection, and rehabilitation that currently circulate in the Asian hemisphere. You will learn about concepts of landscape in Asian religions, philosophy, social sciences, history and the arts and their reverberation in selected environmental projects in China, India and Japan. Furthermore, we will discuss how they are critically reflected upon in the context of the environmental humanities, and observe how an interdisciplinary approach towards regional ecosystems past and present reaches out beyond pragmatic technological solutions to mitigate environmental damage. Following us on our different paths and trajectories through the five modules of the course, you will encounter many of the reasons why environmental humanities study projects which strive to change people’s prevalent attitudes, values and behavioural patterns in order to redeem the rapidly globalizing crisis, and how they go about it. 

Having acquainted yourself with the stories Asia’s landscapes – and landscape representations – tell about actual and possible human-nature relationships, you can compare and evaluate their potential to bring about the desired change and define your own range of actions as an informed stakeholder for creating a sustainable future. What is arguably no less intriguing: you will learn how to appreciate a broad range of eco-aesthetic forms that re-enchant our lives by creatively interacting with the more-than-human world.

You can follow the five modules of the course consecutively or just study the modules that interest you the most. If you want to earn a certificate, you need to complete all of the modules including the quizzes at the end of each module.

Composição: Escrevendo a letra,https://www.coursera.org/learn/composicao-escrevendo-letra,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Pat Pattison,"Existe um compositor dentro de você, rondando, indagando se é o momento certo de se revelar. Agora é. Este curso é um convite para deixar que o compositor que existe dentro de você saia ao sol. Tudo que você precisa é de um ""sim"" e você estará subindo aquela montanha com ventania e se maravilhando com a vista.

Se você não escreveu muitas, ou nenhuma, música, este curso lhe mostrará um processo eficiente e eficaz para compor músicas para expressas suas ideias e emoções. Se você já compôs, olhará o processo com outros olhos, tendo o controle de aspectos do processo que você pode não ter percebido.

Este curso iniciará examinando as ferramentas que estão disponíveis, tudo girando em torno do conceito essencial de prosódia. Você aprenderá a usar suas ferramentas para melhorar sua mensagem - a trabalhar na composição ao mesmo tempo em que desenvolve suas ideias.

Você trabalhará tanto na música como com a letra, ainda que para trabalhar com a música não seja necessário que você saiba ler partituras ou tocar um instrumento. Se você toca, ótimo, e você será encorajado a tocar e gravar suas produções musicais das tarefas. Se você não toca, o curso lhe oferecerá diversas faixas musicais para utilizar. Tudo que você terá que fazer é cantar suas melodias sobre as faixas.

As tarefas solicitarão que você faça postagens para avaliação dos colegas - às vezes trechos ou seções de letras, às vezes melodias, às vezes ambos. Nenhum deles precisa de acabamento. O curso é sobre composição, não sobre interpretação.

E o mais importante de tudo, você se divertirá muito.",1959.0,1793.0,4.9,25.0

I'm delighted to launch another set of new lectures of this course as Part 3. As before, this class is meant for people of all levels of experience with Beethoven's music (including no experience at all!). Remember that you are able to watch the lectures as many times as you like, at whatever pace is comfortable for you.
As I’ve done with the first two sets of Beethoven lectures, I look forward to meeting with students—online and in person, in various cities. The dates and locations will be posted in the Announcements and Events section, as part of the course content. So please remember to check back there for details. 

In these four new lectures, we will explore the following sonatas: 
• Sonata Op. 10, No. 1

Exploring Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas,https://www.coursera.org/learn/beethoven-piano-sonatas,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Jonathan Biss,"Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.

This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music itself. 

This season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson.

Fashion as Design,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fashion-design,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Paola Antonelli, Michelle Millar Fisher, Stephanie Kramer, Anna Burckhardt","Among all objects of design, our clothes are the most universal and intimate. Like other kinds of design, fashion thrives on productive tensions between form and function, automation and craftsmanship, standardization and customization, universality and self-expression, and pragmatism and utopian vision. It exists in the service of others, and it can have profound consequences—social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental.

Fashion as Design focuses on a selection of more than 70 garments and accessories from around the world, ranging from kente cloth to jeans to 3D-printed dresses. Through these garments, we’re going to look closely at what we wear, why we wear it, how it’s made, and what it means. You’ll hear directly from a range of designers, makers, historians, and others working with clothing every day—and, in some cases, reinventing it for the future. Studio visits, interviews, and other resources introduce the history and development of each garment and their changing uses, meanings, and impact over time. 

Course Learning Objectives:

Develop critical tools to appreciate and contextualize fashion design—from everyday clothing to couture garments—through many different perspectives. 

Trace the history, development, and impact of garments over time, and explore how they may be reinvented.

Investigate garments through multiple lenses including politics, identity, and economics. 

Understand more about the lifecycle of clothing, from its design and production to its marketing, distribution, and consumption. 

Better comprehend the choices you make about fashion with respect to the visual language of dress, individual and collective identities, and issues such as labor practices, sustainability, and body politics.",253681.0,79824.0,4.8,2707.0

By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly.

How Music Can Change Your Life,https://www.coursera.org/learn/music-life,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Katrina Skewes McFerran,"Did you ever wonder how music works? 

This course provides free video, audio and journal resources that explain six basic principles about how music can influence individual and community health and wellbeing. From biology and neuroscience, to psychotherapy and politics, the ways we engage with music can make all the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the lives of individuals and communities all around the globe. This course explores the ways that music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable persons. Six different understandings will be explored, each with their own set of values and assumptions. The greatest thinkers in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of music is right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety delivers the best results in each unique circumstance. Once we understand the various ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions about how best to employ its extraordinary power.

Learners who engage in this MOOC can expect to both deepen and broaden their understanding of how music can be used with individuals, groups and communities.

How to Create Color Gradients in Adobe Illustrator,https://www.coursera.org/learn/create-color-gradients-adobe-illustrator,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Nicole Alvelo,"By the end of this project, you would be able to create color gradients in Adobe Illustrator. This is an awesome tool to make your graphics in your way. During this project, we are going to learn how to combine shapes and create a design with them. We will be working on three complete figures so that you can practice and learn about the whole process of creation, apply color, and combine gradients to enjoy how they can be assigned to different creations. You must have on hand, your access to Adobe Cloud, Adobe Illustrator, updated and up to date so that this does not create problems in the process of practicing and creating your content. Important, if you have never had previous training in this application, I want to remind you that this training is an intermediate-advanced level, therefore, you must know basic Illustrator tools so that you can handle what we will be working on in this course.
In the first part of the project, we will begin to create our figures, we will add color to them, and we will be playing with the options available of color gradients, to understand how they can be assigned to the shapes, forms, or complete arts in Adobe Illustrator. We will also see how they expand, shrink, copy, or regenerate different shapes in case you want to make more complex shapes, but within the intermediate training process. After completing this training, you will be able to assign color gradients to your artwork and it will allow you to create your logo or design.

"Interactive, Nonlinear Stories with Twine",https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-stories-twine,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Danilo Oliveira Vaz,"When telling stories, we tend to create one-way narratives that conduct readers through a fixed sequence of events. Even though such an approach allows us to tell very elaborate stories, it's clear that it can only go so far when it comes to complex plots. That is, stories that can unfold in many different ways, depending on the readers' choices and preferences.

In this guided project you will challenge this traditional approach towards story-telling by working with Twine, a tool designed for the creation of interactive, nonlinear stories. Not only will this teach you how to craft engaging stories, it will also equip you with the abilities required for the creation of simple games, such as Mushy Foray (our study object for this project).",,,,

This course strives to give students a new appreciation of music, based on an understanding of the craft behind each work. This class is perfect for those wanting to gain a unique perspective on the creative process of music composition, while challenging traditional notions of how composers approach formal structure, melody, and harmony. 

Week 1 focuses on the question “what is melody?”, and on the meticulous design of Brahms's Intermezzo, op. 118, no. 2. Week 2 concentrates on the fundamentals of harmony, and how Beethoven thought of harmony to generate his Symphony No. 7 in A Major, op. 92. Week 3 applies the same paradigm to a living composer, Bright Sheng himself, and reveals how he found inspiration in the works of these titans of music in his Four Movements for Piano Trio.

Introduction to Ableton Live,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ableton-live,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Erin Barra,"The new version of Introduction to Ableton Live featuring Ableton Live 10 will launch on April 20!

In the past, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) were programs used only by audio engineers with a highly specific knowledge base, on machines inaccessible to most people. But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.

In this Ableton Certified Training Center course developed by Berklee Online, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.

Note: If you do not own Ableton Live 10, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days. If you use the trial version, do not download it until the course is scheduled to begin.",75883.0,19268.0,4.8,1074.0

Introduction to Imagemaking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-making,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Gail Swanlund,"This course for serious makers, and for students new to imagemaking. Imagemaking is a fluid and exciting area of graphic design that comes out of practice and process: experimenting fearlessly, showing and sharing ideas, and giving and receiving knowledgeable and constructive input.

For the sake of this online platform, we have applied some structure to our investigations, but for the most part imagemaking is loose and unstructured. If we must adopt a rule in this course it is only this: you will not become a graphic designer by watching videos alone. Or, don't just make stuff just in your head. So here, the focus here is on making, and you are expected to devote serious time and intellectual energy to that activity in this course. Specifically, you will:

 - experiment with a range of materials and techniques to make images for graphic design
 - expand your visual vocabulary both in terms of making and talking about work, in order to discuss your work and work of others
 - learn how to make, manipulate and arrange images to create compositions, eventually culminating in the design and production of an-image-based book.

The first half of the course is an opportunity to experiment and explore imagemaking in order to expand your visual vocabulary. You will create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or try out a media.

In the second two weeks, we’ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together by composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image’s connotations, meanings, and associations generated through elements of composition and “visual contrasts.” Ultimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.

The results of your assignments (and experiments) may generate something completely unknowable now or in the future—and that's the goal.",101502.0,107136.0,4.5,2640.0

Introduction to Typography,https://www.coursera.org/learn/typography,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Anther Kiley,"Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It’s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology—but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.

In this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We’ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We’ll peek into the  rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We’ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we’ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. 

Informative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating  in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.

Please note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other  page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.",141400.0,130325.0,4.8,5221.0

We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners.  You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.

During the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.

You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  

There is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.

Reimagining Blackness and Architecture,https://www.coursera.org/learn/blackness-architecture,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Arlette Hernandez, Sean Anderson","Architecture structures our daily lives. It shapes our homes, streets, neighborhoods, cities and more. But who gets to create and occupy these spaces? In the United States, a long history of anti-Black racism has created spatial inequalities that are built into the physical environment and erased the stories of Black architects and communities. 

Reimagining Blackness and Architecture explores the relationship between architecture and Blackness as an identity and a lived experience. You’ll hear directly from Black artists, architects, scholars, and writers who reimagine their surroundings and highlight the ways Black makers have changed the world. You’ll see how architects are working to transform American cities into more equitable places using everything from textiles, hip hop, and fiction to spices and spaceships. And you’ll hear from an international range of artists, who create spaces for their communities and make visible the stories of Black life in their work.

The course is structured around five themes: Imagination, Care, Knowledge, Refusal, and Liberation. Each week, through original films, audio interviews, and readings, you’ll expand your understanding of architecture as a practice that reaches across time, place, and form. Creative activities and prompts for reflection will encourage you to consider your own role in shaping your communities.

Richard Schechner's Introduction to Performance Studies,https://www.coursera.org/learn/richard-schechners-introduction-to-performance-studies,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Richard Schechner,"Performance Studies: An Introduction explores the wide world of performance--from theatre, dance, and music to ritual, play, political campaigns, social media, and the performances of everyday life. Performance studies also ranges across cultures--Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, the Americas. And it spans historical periods from the art of the paleolithic caves to YouTube and the avantgarde. This course is devised by Richard Schechner, one of the pioneers of performance studies, in dialogue with more than a dozen expert scholars and artists. Performance Studies: An Introduction puts students in dialogue with the most important ideas, approaches, theories, and questions of this dynamic, new academic field.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

Articulate and analyze the major concepts of performance studies
Identify and analyze performances within the “broad spectrum of performance”--from everyday life and social media to performance art and global spectacles such as the Olympics
Comprehend key terms of performance studies, including is/as performance, restored behavior, ritual, play, make-belief/make-believe, performance in everyday life, the performative, and intercultural performance
Produce collaborative work that demonstrates teamwork in applying ideas learned in the course
Compare, analyze, and interpret performances of their own and other cultures
Articulate how the major concepts of the course relate to their own experiences and worldviews
Analyze and criticize in a constructive way the work of classmates

The lessons present Schechner’s concept of performance studies along with online assignments. In the assignments, students apply what they are learning by composing short responses to materials, writing in their NYU Classes Forums, and by reviewing other students’ forum posts each week.

Students choose either to work in groups of 3 to 5 on a term-long project maintaining a project portfolio in NYU Classes or to write a research paper. During the term, each group will lead an in-class 25-minute discussion of their project-in-progress. During the last face-to-face class, each group will present their project.

This is a course designed to tap into your creativity and is based in ""Active Learning"". Most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.

""Thank you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing our scripts. This aspect was very important to me."" Ingrid

The course curriculum is simple: you’ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with your peers. 

I am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won’t ""show"" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.

“David's lecture style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When I watch the lectures I feel David’s sincere desire for me to create something truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing; not by watching him talk at us.” - A R Adamson

What you’ll need to get started:

To begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.

Learner Review: ""I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David's guidance is spot on, he's his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough, and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! ""

Seeing Through Photographs,https://www.coursera.org/learn/photography,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Sarah Meister,"Taking, sharing, and viewing photographs has become second nature for many of us. Given our near-constant engagement with images this course will help you dig into the meaning of pictures and reconsider photography’s role in our visual culture. This course aims to address the gap between seeing and truly understanding photographs by introducing a diversity of ideas, approaches, and technologies that inform their making. 

In this course you will look closely at 100 photographs from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, going behind the scenes of the Museum and into artist studios through original films and audio interviews. You will hear a variety of perspectives on the ways photography has been used throughout its 180-year history: as a means of artistic expression, a tool for science and exploration, an instrument of documentation, a way to tell stories and record histories, and a mode of communication and critique. Short texts and readings from MoMA publications provide enhanced context for the works in the course. 

By enrolling in this course, you’ll join a community of international learners in discussion forums, receive invitations to live and virtual events from our lead instructor Sarah Meister, and gain exclusive access to MoMA resources.

UPDATE:
We’ve been listening to your feedback! In September 2020, we launched new content in Seeing Through Photographs, including audio interviews with additional contemporary artists from around the world, videos of Sarah introducing key ideas, and almost doubling the number of photographs from the collection. We’ve also added opportunities for you to share and receive feedback on your photographs in the discussion forums.",390101.0,70052.0,4.8,4160.0

In this course you will learn how: 

* Gender and sexuality is an integral part of the production and reception of works of art
* To increase your understanding of paintings through theories of gender and sexuality
* To understand key terms from gender-related theories of art history and museology
* To recognise the operation of what is termed ‘the gaze’ and how it works in relation to paintings
* Ideas about gender and sexuality can productively be employed in theorising art curatorial practices
* To take the initiative in relating theoretical ideas about gender and sexuality to the reading and display of art and visual cultures.

Sharpened Visions: A Poetry Workshop,https://www.coursera.org/learn/poetry-workshop,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Douglas Kearney,"Why just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.

Though any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). 

We'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",111323.0,47124.0,4.8,1570.0

If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.

The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.

You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.

Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.

The course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. 

Through analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations.

The Blues: Understanding and Performing an American Art Form,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-blues,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Dariusz Terefenko,"The blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz. Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.

This seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.",31233.0,8943.0,4.8,561.0
The Cycle: Management of Successful Arts and Cultural Organizations,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-cycle,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Michael M. Kaiser, Brett Egan","What makes a successful arts and cultural organization? Led by DeVos Institute Chairman Michael M. Kaiser and President Brett Egan, this course will introduce you to a management theory called the Cycle which supports thriving arts and cultural organizations. Learning from our work with managers from over 80 countries around the world, the DeVos Institute developed the Cycle as a simple, but powerful tool to assist managers in their effort to respond to an increasingly complex environment and propel their institutions to excellence. 

The Cycle explains how great art and strong marketing can create a family of supporters, who in turn help the organization produce the revenue required to support even more great art the next year. The Institute has seen the Cycle work in performing and presenting organizations, as well as museums, arts schools, and other nonprofit endeavors like service organizations, historical societies, public libraries, university programs, advocacy organizations, botanical gardens, and zoos.

By taking this course, you will learn: 

• the importance of bold, exciting, and mission-driven programming in an organization; 
• how long-term artistic planning can help an organization produce this work; 
• how an organization can aggressively market that programming and the institution behind it to develop a family of supporters - including ticket buyers, board members, donors, trustees and volunteers; 
• how an organization can cultivate and steward this family to build a healthy base of earned and contributed income; and 
• how an organization can reinvest that income into increasingly ambitious programming year after year.

All course material is available upon enrollment for self-paced learners. New scheduled sessions begin each month.

The Importance and Power of Music in our Society,https://www.coursera.org/learn/importance-power-music-our-society,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Marcel Cobussen, Hafez Ismaïli M'Hamdi","Music plays an important role in our daily lives and is woven into the fabric of society. We listen to music while alone or in company, in a dance club or at home, through simple headphones or via high-end speakers, as background or as foreground, after we get up or before we go to bed. Music accompanies us when we are traveling, doing sports, shopping, working or relaxing. This omnipresence of music raises several questions: how does music affect our lives? What is the relation between the society we live in and the role, function, and position of music within that society? How is music influenced by and does music influence social, political, economic, technological, and multiple other developments? 

Do these questions trigger you? Music and Society provides a thorough introduction to the various ways in which music and society are connected through engaging lectures, insightful interviews, challenging assignments, interesting readings, and of course a lot of musical examples. The course aims at increasing your insights on where, how and why we listen to music, how music contributes to shaping our identity, how music forms, expresses, and subverts political ideas, and how music affects our norms and values.",11557.0,4373.0,4.6,60.0
The Language of Design: Form and Meaning,https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-language,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,"Yasmin Khan Gibson, Randy Nakamura","In this course, critique is defined as a detailed, objective analysis of a work of graphic design and its effectiveness. Critique is an integral part of the making process for designers: it’s not just how we determine if a work of design is or is not successful, it’s how we move our work forward. Critique is also where other voices and opinions can be brought into the design process. 

This course will introduce a lexicon (or vocabulary) in order for you to demonstrate clearer and more considered ways of talking about graphic design in the context of critique. Through this lexicon and a provided Critique Framework, we will model and then practice objectively describing how well a work of design functions based on specific, clearly articulated criteria. By refining this skill, you will enhance your ability to communicate about design with peers, colleagues, and clients. 

This course is essential to anyone looking to develop and refine a critical vocabulary around talking about art and design, such as:
 - practicing graphic designers at all levels
 - future and current students of art or design programs
 - teachers teaching visual art, design, or related subjects
 - any stakeholder in a design project that needs to communicate effectively with designers on their team.  

This course is recommended to learners enrolled in either the Graphic Design Specialization or UI/UX Design Specialization on Coursera to further develop their skills in graphic design. You may take this course before, during, or after completing either Specialization. 

Note this is not an art appreciation course for a general audience. While no prior experience is required to begin, the knowledge and skills taught in this course is useful only if you have some relationship to design in a professional context, i.e., practicing, studying, or teaching design, or working directly with designers.

There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band.

The Technology of Music Production,https://www.coursera.org/learn/technology-of-music-production,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Loudon Stearns,"Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.

With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.
    
Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. 

We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. 
    
Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. 

After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.
    
In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.",56498.0,42948.0,4.8,959.0

Have you ever read a book, seen a movie, watched a television show, or played a game that centred around different aspects of a larger story or universe? You may be familiar with popular examples of such universes like Star Wars, Marvel, and The Walking Dead (to name a few). 

How do the professionals develop such expansive narratives? How do they ensure that each element stays true to the original story? How do they innovatively use different technologies to share the stories, grow audiences and create an active and involved community of fans? 

More and more, we are also engaging with elements or franchises of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms like interactive web experiences, social media communities, mobile devices, theme parks, and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms.


WHAT WILL I LEARN?
This course  will help you to design a strategy for developing and telling your own transmedia story. You will learn about what it takes to:
• Shape your ideas into compelling and well structured narratives and complex story worlds
• Identify, understand, and engage different audiences in your stories
• Create cohesive user experiences across different platforms
• Evaluate existing and emerging technologies to share your story with the world, and help your audience participate in the larger storyworld you create

Understanding the Music Business: What is Music Worth?,https://www.coursera.org/learn/musicbiz,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Jen Gunderman,"This course will examine the music industry in the United States, with the unique perspective gained by Vanderbilt University’s location in Nashville, TN.  Nashville is a major center of music in the United States, and the music created here has a global reach, particularly in the country, rock, pop, singer-songwriter, and Americana genres.  However, students will learn that the basic principles of recording, marketing, copyright, licensing, and live performance are the same, regardless of musical style or genre.

The music business is one of the most rapidly changing industries in the US today.  It is also an industry filled with contradiction, and media headlines and anecdotal stories often add to the confusion.  Here are just a few statements paraphrased from recent news stories: 

* The music business has collapsed
* Demand for music is expanding at the greatest rate in history
* Historic recording studios are closing at an alarming rate
* More people are making recordings than ever before
* Musicians usually lose money touring
* Musicians usually make money touring
* Major artist pulls songs off streaming services because they don’t pay fairly
* Major artist makes a fortune from streaming services
* People won’t buy records anymore
* Vinyl record sales are soaring

This course will attempt to make sense of these seemingly contradictory trends and data, outline the basic structure and mechanisms of today’s music industry, and encourage students to think critically and entrepreneurially about the future of music.  Leaders from various areas of the music business will lend their perspectives through in-depth interviews, and footage from a recording session will give learners a behind the scenes look at how a song goes from the spark of an idea hummed into a cell phone to a finished recording.

Participants will grapple with questions about art and commerce which are both timeless and crucially important today, and will emerge from this course with tools allowing them to make more informed decisions as creators, promoters, and consumers of music.

Words Spun Out of Images: Visual and Literary Culture in Nineteenth Century Japan,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-literary-culture-in-japan,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Robert Campbell,"In their ambition to capture “real life,” Japanese painters, poets, novelists and photographers of the nineteenth century collaborated in ways seldom explored by their European contemporaries. This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic “realism” is and what it meant.

Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.",21944.0,14179.0,4.8,663.0
World Design for Video Games,https://www.coursera.org/learn/video-game-world,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Théotime Vaillant,"Start creating your world. A game world is not just a backdrop for your game—be it minimal or detailed, contained or part of a much bigger universe, it provides the context for your player. Ultimately, a game world should feel alive and wholly unique to any player who will experience it. 

In this course, we will explore game worlds in existing games and study the art and influences that inform their themes and styles. We will also investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. We’ll also look at navigation and the elements that make your world as real (or unreal) as you want it to be. A weekly challenge will prompt you to explore styles and inspirations for possible game worlds, and you’ll learn effective ways to communicate your ideas from concepts to presentation-worthy proofs of concept.",30796.0,24566.0,4.4,751.0

Learner review: ""Love the approach Professor Wheeler takes towards this course. It's to the point, easy to follow, and very informative! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking a Screenplay Writing course!

The course curriculum is simple: We will adopt a professional writers room process in which you’ll write, post your work for peer review, share feedback with your peers and revise your work with the feedback you receive from your peers. That's how we do it in the real world. You will feel as if you were in a professional writers room yet no prior experience as a writer is required. I'm a proponent of Experiential Learning (Active Learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won’t ""show"" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.

Learner Review: ""I would like to thank this course instructor. It's an amazing course""

What you’ll need to get started: As mentioned above, no prior script writing experience is required. To begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, the industry standard, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.

In Write Your First Novel, you’ll learn to break down your creative endeavor into components and you’ll discover a process that will allow you to do what few have done: produce and complete a full-length work of fiction in the form of a 50,000-word novel. 

Learner Review: ""You teach storytelling like no other teacher. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate it. This daily writing, and the product that comes with it, have been a great mental support during the pandemic time. Art is a support for life, as Stephen King said, and thanks to you I experienced it first-hand during this time. I think I will keep writing 500 words per night for the rest of my life. I owe it to you. You taught me how to write a novel, and it works every time.  Huge thanks, and wishing you all the best.""

By looking at examples from a wide range of genres, including film, song, painting—even the theme music for Jaws!—we’ll practice exercising the creative muscle that sees ourselves as characters and the experiences we’ve had as tales. We’ll focus on critical elements, like how to begin a story, what makes for worthy content, the essential use of detail, the strengths and limits of dialogue, the power of the white space. The ultimate goal is for us to become aware of an “audience” when we write, so that the documentation of our lives will begin to resemble a “performance” crafted onto paper rather than a private entry in a journal.",14593.0,6772.0,4.2,86.0

We will explore the ways in which language can be used to create tone, so that the emotional freight of your words is as potent as the storytelling.

Слова и изображения — структурные элементы графического дизайна — несут в себе большую часть контента как в цифровом, так и в печатном мире. Графический дизайн становится все более заметным и распространенным в нашей жизни, а графический дизайн в качестве практики — более важным в нашей культуре.

На визуальных примерах этот курс ознакомит вас с основными принципами графического дизайна: создание изображений, типографика, композиция, работа с цветом и формой — основополагающими навыками, которые являются общими для всех областей практики графического дизайна. Нужно, чтобы вы не просто посмотрели видеоролики, где говорят о дизайне, необходимо, чтобы вы РАЗРАБОТАЛИ дизайн. Чтобы стать дизайнером, нужно быть творцом и специалистом по коммуникации, поэтому в этом курсе вам будет предоставлено множество возможностей для экспериментирования при выполнении упражнений и более практических проектов.

В конце этого курса вы научитесь исследовать и изучать визуальное представление с помощью целого ряда техник создания изображений; усвоите основные принципы работы с формой, цветом и рисунком; ознакомитесь с терминами и навыками работы с типографикой; поймете и примените на практике принципы композиции и визуального контраста. По завершении курса и выполнении дополнительных брифов (настоятельно рекомендуется) вы будете обладать базовым набором навыков графического дизайна, которые сможете использовать в своих собственных проектах или для более глубокого изучения специализированной области графического дизайна.

Для успешного прохождения этого курса вам потребуется доступ к компьютеру. Курс можно пройти и без компьютера, но это будет труднее.

唐詩新思路 (Tang Poetry),https://www.coursera.org/learn/tang-poems,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,歐麗娟,"唐詩不僅是詩歌史上一座巍峨的高峰，亦是人類文明的珍貴獻禮。本課程的目的並非對詩人、詩歌作一般性的概論，而是以專題的方式抽繹由初唐到晚唐詩歌的許多面向，除了釐清傳統文學史中對部分詩作的誤讀與偏見，更引領大家用不同的角度看待諸位著名詩人，如：陳子昂、王維、李白、杜甫、白居易、李商隱等。

初唐的陳子昂除了大家耳熟能詳的〈登幽州臺歌〉外，文學史上總將陳子昂形塑為復古派的健將，其師法漢魏古調的精神，六朝靡麗遺風彷彿在陳子昂的主張下開始動搖。然而，陳子昂真的完全反對六朝，以復古為目標嗎？在現存的文獻當中，是否有其他的依據？
至於一向被目為「自然派詩人」的盛唐詩人王維，其實詩歌成就寬廣深厚得多，歷來吟誦不已的名篇屈指難數，其中，〈雜詩〉三首之二作為漂泊他鄉之作，「來日綺窗前，寒梅著花未」是否有其他深意？王維遇到久別的鄉親時，問的為什麼是「寒梅著花未」呢？另外，飄逸不羈的詩人李白，在宮中留下的名篇〈清平調詞三首〉，究竟「可憐飛燕倚新妝」一語有何深意？是否真有諷刺楊貴妃的意思？這組詩的主旨究竟何在？再者，婚戀是每一個人生命中的內容，但隨著時代與個性的不同，詩人對妻子的描繪也大異其趣，「詩聖」杜甫除了憂國憂民、沉鬱頓挫的一面，在較不為人所知的〈月夜〉詩中，杜甫又是怎麼看待他的妻子？

還有，中唐詩人白居易的〈琵琶行〉是歷來傳誦不已的名篇，但「琵琶女」的造型仍有值得深入研究之處，且白居易在〈琵琶行〉中如何傾注他的「投射心理」？最後，晚唐詩人李商隱，其〈錦瑟〉風靡無數讀者，此詩亦為詩人晚年對一生的回顧，隱含了理解其性格特質的鑰匙，而末聯「此情可待成追憶，只是當時已惘然」的傳統解讀多有謬誤，其真正涵義為何？當將在唐詩的課程中一一釐清。",15867.0,12449.0,4.9,513.0

微影人的自我修养,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wei-dian-ying,Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,许 肖潇,"目前市面上有越来越多的微电影技术与流程方面的教程，通过它们你可以知道拍微电影大致的制作流程与技术，但这样你接触的只是微电影创作的皮毛。因为，拍微电影，从根本上说我们面对的是人：演员、工作人员、观众这些活生生的人，而人比机器要难把握多了。因此，微电影创作是一种独具风格、需要深入复杂人性与感受的深层次独立创作。

本课程授课教师本着“授人以鱼，不如授人以渔”的原则，直面现有微电影实践教学中“只重技术与流程、不重观念与思维”的普遍性问题，总结多年的创作体验和授课心得，将课程分为“亲临微电影创作现场” 、 “ 勤修微影人观念”、“勤养微电影思维” 的渐进式三大模块，通过项目创作和情境再现的直观形式，带你从了解微电影的拍摄与流程的实质开始，逐步深入微电影的剧本创意与写作、角色塑造、主题表达、叙事方式、风格形成等方面真正的要点与难点，让你真切领会到微电影的创作精髓； 同时，深入研究微电影与电影在本质上、创作上的异同，提炼出微电影创作人在“初心、情怀、风格、思维、结构、细节、人物、细节、流程”等各个方面所应具备的素质与观念，并引导微影人将这些微电影素养的培养作为长期的目标坚持下去，使它变成你的自身素养的一部分，促使你达到对客观世界与对象的更高境界的感受与把握。从而在这些扎实修养的基础之上，哪怕只给你一个手机，你也依然创作出独具魅力的微电影“大片”。

授课原则：
不讲某一个软件、某一个设备的具体的操作方法。
不讲非常完善的理论体系。（因为这些内容相关书籍或在线教程有很多，教师会在必要的时候给出相应的资料、教程链接以供补充学习与参考）
不提供技术词典。
