With this course, recorded on campus at UCSD, we seek to share our access to top people in the field who bring an unprecedented range of expertise on drug commercialization.

This course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.

In addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .

Pre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.

Module 3 shows a methodology within the implementation class. These methods are designed to overcome emotional and organizational barriers to translating evidence-based interventions into practice.  The fourth and last module looks at one more way to approach improvement projects in the discovery class.  These tools are specifically for new, out-of-the-box design thinking.",6018.0,7029.0,4.7,138.0
Population Health: Alternative Payment Models,https://www.coursera.org/learn/alternative-payment-models,Health,Healthcare Management,Jeroen Struijs,"The way we currently pay our care providers lead to suboptimal outcomes and unnecessary spending. Consequently, we fail to maximize the value of our health care services. We need to change provider payment models in order to keep health care systems financial sustainability. Doing nothing is not an option. But the question is, how do we do it? 

During this course, we will discuss the rationale for payment reforms and dive into the key design elements of Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and how they change care provider incentives. You will learn about a roadmap to design and implement APMs on your own. You will learn about behavioural economics and human behaviour which are essential to advance the design and implementation of APMs. After the course you can apply your sharpened skills to lead change in health care via innovative payment models in order to increase value of health care services.

This course is targeted at a variety of professionals in the healthcare sector in order to realise a common language. Are you a provider, board member, working at a public or private payer or researcher working in the health sector, this course is relevant for you!

Population Health: Panel Management Next Level,https://www.coursera.org/learn/panel-management,Health,Healthcare Management,"Rimke Vos, Mattijs Numans","How can you, as a healthcare professional, identify patients that share the same risk of an adverse event? How do you transform your healthcare practice in such a way that you are not only able to provide proactive care but you are also able to improve the health of populations at risk?

In this course you will learn how to apply the panel management approach to tackle these questions in order to change from reactive to proactive care. 

You will learn how to empanel (patient)groups that share the same risk and how you can allocate the appropriate intervention to each panel of patients. From there you will dive into ways to transform current workflows for optimal in-reach and out-reach care both at the cultural and behavioral change level. As a final step you will learn how to evaluate both effectiveness and process based on the triple aim. This will give you insight into what can be improved in the next panel management cycle. 

This course will help you gain an understanding of the panel management approach and enable you to change from reactive to proactive care.

Quality Improvement in Healthcare Organizations,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quality-improvement-in-healthcare-organizations,Health,Healthcare Management,"Margaret Kilduff, Ph.D.","Have you ever though that healthcare quality could be improved - either where you get health care treatment or where you delivery health care?  Have you ever thought that there should be a way for you to determine the relative quality of your choices? Have you found yourself thinking that there should be a way for you to provide your view and input on the quality of healthcare organization? Or do you work in a healthcare organization and find yourself thinking that there must be better ways to continuously and systematically improve the quality of your healthcare organization? If you have, this course is for you.

Course content includes an overview of quality and quality improvement programs, measures, and data in healthcare organizations.  The course provides links to external sites to connect you to the larger ""real world"" of healthcare organization quality and quality improvement. The links also serve as resources you can take with you after you complete the course experience. And because everyone loves a road trip/field trip, there are also ""virtual field trips"" to the often hidden places of interest on the web. 

The course format is readings, videos, quizzes, and a project.  The project requires you to synthesize course material to design a quality improvement program for a healthcare organization the way you would have things run in the best of all worlds. The design (submitted as an electronic spreadsheet) is an artifact of the course which you can circulate to colleagues or use as the basis for talks or presentations.",7078.0,11503.0,4.7,145.0
Regulated Competition in Healthcare Systems: Theory & Practice,https://www.coursera.org/learn/regulated-competition-healthcare-systems,Health,Healthcare Management,"Richard van Kleef, Erik Schut, Frank Eijkenaar, Wynand van de Ven, Marco Varkevisser","In this MOOC you will learn about the theory and practice of 'regulated competition' (also known as 'managed competition') in healthcare systems. Many countries have implemented or consider implementation of regulated competition in healthcare. Examples include Australia, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Israel, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. After completing this MOOC, you will be able to explain how regulated competition (in theory) promotes affordability, accessibility and efficiency of healthcare. Moreover, you will be able to explain why (in practice) successful implementation of regulated competition is very complex and often requires difficult trade-offs between policy objectives. We think this MOOC is highly valuable to any student, researcher or professional interested in healthcare system reform and design. Specific topics in this MOOC include a typology of healthcare systems, the economics of healthcare markets, theory and preconditions of regulated competition, risk adjustment and risk selection in health insurance, competition policy and provider payment.",2217.0,3199.0,4.8,28.0
Researcher Management and Leadership Training,https://www.coursera.org/learn/researcher-management-leadership-training,Health,Healthcare Management,"Anne M. Libby, PhD","This course is for early career researchers and mentors who believe that modern scientific careers require management skills and want to be research leaders. This curriculum gives you skills to effectively implement funded projects, thereby enhancing your career success. Research leaders take on a number of new roles, rights, and responsibilities--as scientific leaders, financial administrators, managers, and mentors. In this course, we explain how to optimize the people, teams, projects, and finances for which you are responsible. 

Despite your research training, you are probably facing an urgent training gap in leadership and management skills. Scientific careers falter for non-science reasons when researchers fail to execute a scope of work: struggle to track expenses and returns substantial unspent grant funds; or run out of funds by spending on the wrong people or mismanaging the right people. Consequently, projects close with inadequate progress on aims, thus compromising successful competition for future funding. This course will help avoid these traps.

Leadership and management are essential skills for researchers. Several early career researchers, senior scientists, and administrative leaders are eager to share their expertise and experiences with you.",10717.0,18637.0,4.9,275.0

Severe to Profound Intellectual Disability: Circles of Care and Education,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-disability-care-education,Health,Healthcare Management,Judith McKenzie,"This course is about caring for and educating children (and youth) with severe to profound intellectual disability. We use the idea of 'circles' to position the child at the center of the many levels of support needed. Around the child are circles of care and education - such as the parents, family, friends, caregivers, educators, health care workers and others such as neighbors, business owners and community members. Each one has an important role to play in the life of a person with an intellectual disability and can be seen as a caregiver and educator. Although this course is aimed particularly at caregivers who work at a  special centre or in a private home, each person in the circle of care and education plays a valuable role and will find the course useful.  

During the course you can gain greater understanding about intellectual disability,  levels of severity of intellectual disability and the history of intellectual disability. You will also start to understand how you can support children and youth with severe to profound intellectual disability so that they can reach their full potential and become participating members of society.  We look at lifelong learning by exploring brain development, the learning process and how to maximise the opportunities for learning.

With input from a range of experts,  we consider how best learning can be facilitated.  This includes looking at children’s learning support needs, how to go about planning activities for the learning programme as well as how to empower multiple people who work in a team to care and educate children with severe to profound intellectual disability.

In the last week, we focus on rights, advocacy and relationships of care. Empowering and caring for caregivers themselves is a key focus of the course.

For professional development purposes, you can purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you can apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.",6888.0,10123.0,4.8,108.0
