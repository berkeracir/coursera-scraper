"Dense Gases, Liquids and Solids",https://www.coursera.org/learn/dense-gases-liquids-solids,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,John W. Daily,"Course 4 of Statistical Thermodynamics addresses dense gases, liquids, and solids. As the density of a gas is increased, intermolecular forces begin to affect behavior. For small departures from ideal gas behavior, known as the dense gas limit, one can estimate the change in properties using the concept of a configuration integral, a modification to the partition function. This leads to the development of equations of state that are expansions in density from the ideal gas limit. Inter molecular potential energy functions are introduced and it is explored how they impact P-V-T behavior. As the density is increased, there is a transition to the liquid state. We explore whether this transition is smooth or abrupt by examining the stability of a thermodynamic system to small perturbations. We then present a brief discussion regarding the determination of the thermodynamic properties of liquids using concept of the radial distribution function (RDF), and how the function relates to thermodynamic properties. Finally, we explore two simple models of crystalline solids.",4747.0,2242.0,4.5,109.0

Generative Design for Performance and Weight Reduction,https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-design-performance-weight-reduction,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Autodesk,"There are many considerations and factors that play a part in designing a new product. Cost is usually a big one, but sometimes there are other factors that are the main contributors to a product's direction. With vehicles, specifically motorcycles, we see advanced engineering practices performed on seemingly minor parts. In some instances, making a part as light as possible can have a big effect on performance. In other cases, the strength or stiffness of a part, such as a motor mount, is more critical than its mass. Generative design allows us the ability to solve for both problems at the same time and make informed design decisions without the sacrifice. In this course, we’ll explore how generative design can be applied to motorcycle parts to help reduce mass while also increasing performance.

In this course, you will learn how a material’s properties are determined by the microstructure of the material, which is in turn determined by composition and the processing that the material has undergone.

This is the second of three Coursera courses that mirror the Introduction to Materials Science class that is taken by most engineering undergrads at Georgia Tech.  The aim of the course is to help students better understand the engineering materials that are used in the world around them.  This first section covers the fundamentals of materials science including atomic structure and bonding, crystal structure, atomic and microscopic defects, and noncrystalline materials such as glasses, rubbers, and polymers.",25245.0,10960.0,4.8,969.0

We also discuss the principles behind the manufacturing of those materials.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
* Recognize the important aspects of the materials used in modern engineering applications,
* Explain the underlying principle of materials science: “structure leads to properties,”
* Identify the role of thermally activated processes in many of these important “things” – as illustrated by the Arrhenius relationship.
* Relate each of these topics to issues that have arisen (or potentially could arise) in your life and work.

Simulation Analysis for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360,https://www.coursera.org/learn/simulation-analysis-mechanical-engineers,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Autodesk,"The foundation of engineering design is often coupled with validation. Simulation is a great tool that allows engineers to test, validate, and modify designs before they become a physical prototype. When used early in the process for simulation driven design and throughout the development process, simulation can help drive the design, make informed design decisions, speed up time to production, and most importantly, identify and eliminate costly design mistakes.  

Like any other tool though, it must be used properly to yield the best results. In this course, we’ll explore the usage static stress simulation, shape optimization, thermal and other mechanical simulation types to better understand how we can apply these tools to everyday design problems.

After taking this course, you'll be able to:

- Describe the simulation workflow in Fusion 360.
- Summarize the use cases for various types of simulation studies.
- Demonstrate knowledge and skills in more advanced Fusion 360 CAD and CAE skills.

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/finite-element-method,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,"Krishna Garikipati, Ph.D.","This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.

The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an
introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is
natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not
formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a
competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional
analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the
methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite
Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical
foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner
presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,
although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.

The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):
elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to
the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in
one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We
then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and
mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems
in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next
(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in
three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to
questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who
followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical
development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.

Books:
There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required
textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader
treatments than can be provided in any form of class:

How can the traffic collapse of the global multimillion cities be prevented? One way out could lead upwards: Urban air transport. By 2030, it is estimated that around 60 percent of humanity will live in cities. If it is possible to shift some of the traffic from the roads to the air, researchers believe this could help to further ensure the basic human need for mobility. But there are still some technical, social, and legal preconditions to be met. 

The course gives a first introduction to the relatively new field of Urban Air Mobility, explaining the technical background as well as giving an overview of all other necessities such as air traffic management, public acceptance, and ecological sustainability.

房屋為我們遮風避雨，讓我們安心工作、生活，而結構系統又是房屋的骨幹，讓房屋能站的又高、又直、又穩。你知道橫者為梁，直者為柱，但你知道在結構工程師的眼中，梁與柱有什麼其他的不同嗎？他們其中藏著什麼秘密，能支撐起整個結構？工程師要怎麼決定梁該有多深？柱該有多粗？該用矩形、圓形還是其他形狀？該用實心還是空心？在有地震的地方，設計上是否又有不一樣的考量？
　　材料力學是通往上述問題解答關鍵的一步。在材料力學(一)裡，我們會由大家熟知的虎克定律開始，以蓋房子的重要材料「結構鋼」為例，深入探討「力量」與「變形」這兩個令結構工程師愛恨交加的物理量之間的關係。然後依序探討結構桿件受軸力（拉/壓）、受扭、受彎、受剪四大外力作用下，會在桿件內部產生怎樣的相對應變形與受力，並探討建築結構設計概念與提供桿件設計演算範例。
