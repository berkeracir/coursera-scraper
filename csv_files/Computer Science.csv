3D Graphics in Android: Sensors and VR,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-graphics-android-sensors-vr,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,Benny Lo,"This course is an ideal introduction into creating virtual environments in Android.  This course is unique as it covers a range of tools and techniques to create immersive 3D environments, giving you a rounded skill set in this growing field.  By the end of this course, you will really be able to bring your VR ideas to life!  

The first part of the course covers animation, lighting and reflection.  We then move onto textures and handling multiple 3D objects.  Finally, we'll look at housing all of this within a binocular view to create a VR experience. 

There are practical exercises throughout the course to apply your understanding, and there is a summative project which can form part of your professional portfolio.

This course assumes a knowledge of Android programming and OpenGL. I recommend completing my two Coursera courses on these topics, as these are the perfect primer.",9225.0,1773.0,4.6,10.0
3D Interaction Design in Virtual Reality,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-interaction-design-virtual-reality,Computer Science,Design and Product, Dr Sylvia Xueni Pan,"This course will teach you about one of the most important aspects of VR, how you interact with a VR world. Virtual Reality is completely different from an on screen app or game. You are completely immersed in a VR world, so it doesn't make sense to interact only through buttons or menus. You will get the most out of VR if you can interact with the world just as you would with the real world: with your natural body movements. You will learn about the basic concepts and technologies of VR Interaction. You will then get hands on, learning about how to move around in VR and how to interact with the objects in your world. The course will finish with some advice from experts on VR interaction design and you will do a project where you will get real experience of developing VR Interaction.",14081.0,14229.0,4.6,123.0
3D Models for Virtual Reality,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-models-virtual-reality,Computer Science,Design and Product, Dr Sylvia Xueni Pan,"This course will begin your journey to creating Virtual Reality experiences. A Virtual Reality experience is a new world that you step into and are entirely immersed in. Creating a VR experience means creating that world and all the objects in it. 

In this course you will learn the basics of 3D graphics: how we create objects and how to lay them out to create an environment. You will learn techniques like materials and texturing that make your objects appear realistic. You will also learn about audio techniques to ensure that your experiences sound great as well as looking great. In all of these topics we will pay attention to the particular requirements of Virtual Reality, including pitfalls and performance issues: making sure your environment runs fast enough in VR. 

You will learn all of this using the professional game and VR engine, Unity3D. Unity is one of the most used game engine and is a relatively easy, but fully featured, introduction to 3D development. 

The course will culminate in a project in which you will create your own VR scene. VR development is something you can only learn by doing it yourself, so working on your project will be the best way to learn.",39418.0,22889.0,4.6,366.0
3D Reconstruction - Multiple Viewpoints,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction-multiple-viewpoints,Computer Science,Algorithms,Shree Nayar,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from images taken from different viewpoints. We start by first building a comprehensive geometric model of a camera and then develop a method for finding (calibrating) the internal and external parameters of the camera model. Then, we show how two such calibrated cameras, whose relative positions and orientations are known, can be used to recover the 3D structure of the scene. This is what we refer to as simple binocular stereo. Next, we tackle the problem of uncalibrated stereo where the relative positions and orientations of the two cameras are unknown. Interestingly, just from the two images taken by the cameras, we can both determine the relative positions and orientations of the cameras and then use this information to estimate the 3D structure of the scene. 

Next, we focus on the problem of dynamic scenes. Given two images of a scene that includes moving objects, we show how the motion of each point in the image can be computed. This apparent motion of points in the image is called optical flow. Optical flow estimation allows us to track scene points over a video sequence. Next, we consider the video of a scene shot using a moving camera, where the motion of the camera is unknown. We present structure from motion that takes as input tracked features in such a video and determines not only the 3D structure of the scene but also how the camera moves with respect to the scene. The methods we develop in the course are widely used in object modeling, 3D site modeling, robotics, autonomous navigation, virtual reality and augmented reality.",,7022.0,4.7,12.0
3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction---single-viewpoint,Computer Science,Algorithms,Shree Nayar,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.

In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. 

Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.",1582.0,7928.0,4.9,10.0

Rather than trying to define computational thinking, we’ll just say it’s a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means!

This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous two courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed below. 

Prerequisite computational thinking knowledge: Algorithms and procedures and data collection, analysis, and representation
Prerequisite C knowledge: Data types, variables, constants; STEM computations; selection; and iteration (looping)

Throughout this course the computational thinking topics you'll explore are abstraction, which is deciding which details matter for the problem you're trying to solve, and problem decomposition, which is about breaking large problems into smaller sub-problems to handle complexity. For the programming topics, you'll continue building on your C knowledge by practicing using arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable, and strings, which are arrays of characters. You'll also learn how to implement functions, which are the mechanism we use for problem decomposition in our C programs.

Module 1: Learn about arrays as a way to store multiple values in a single variable
Module 2: Discover how we store and process strings (arrays of characters)
Module 3: Explore abstraction and problem decomposition
Module 4: Use functions to implement problem decomposition in your code",3537.0,1986.0,4.7,33.0

In part 2 of this course, we will study advanced algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming.  As the central part of the course, students will implement several algorithms in Python that incorporate these techniques and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.

Once students have completed this class, they will have both the mathematical and programming skills to analyze, design, and program solutions to a wide range of computational problems.  While this class will use Python as its vehicle of choice to practice Algorithmic Thinking, the concepts that you will learn in this class transcend any particular programming language.",22970.0,16886.0,4.7,205.0

If you’d like to explore how we can interact with the world in a rigorous, computational way, and would also like to start learning to program, this is the course for you!

You may have heard lots of talk about computational thinking recently, but if you ask 10 different people what it is you’ll probably get 10 different answers. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, we’ll just say it’s a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. In this course, we’ll explore algorithms and data collection.

Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means! You’ll start learning how to develop C programs in this course by writing your first C program; learning about data types, variables, and constants; and honing your C programming skills by implementing a variety of STEM computations. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience, so don't worry if you've never written code before.

If that all sounds interesting to you, go ahead and jump into the course!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since the courses in this specialization are built from a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Approximation Algorithms,https://www.coursera.org/learn/approximation-algorithms,Computer Science,Algorithms,Mark de Berg,"Many real-world algorithmic problems cannot be solved efficiently using traditional algorithmic tools, for example because the problems are NP-hard. The goal of this course is to become familiar with important algorithmic concepts and techniques needed to effectively deal with such problems. These techniques apply when we don't require the optimal solution to certain problems, but an approximation that is close to the optimal solution. We will see how to efficiently find such approximations. 

Prerequisites:
In order to successfully take this course, you should already have a basic knowledge of algorithms and mathematics. Here's a short list of what you are supposed to know:
- O-notation, Ω-notation, Θ-notation; how to analyze algorithms
- Basic calculus: manipulating summations, solving recurrences, working with logarithms, etc.
- Basic probability theory: events, probability distributions, random variables, expected values etc.
- Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps
- (Balanced) binary search trees
- Basic sorting algorithms, for example MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort
- Graph terminology, representations of graphs (adjacency lists and adjacency matrix), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest paths)

The material for this course is based on the course notes that can be found under the resources tab.  We will not cover everything from the course notes. The course notes are there both for students who did not fully understand the lectures as well as for students who would like to dive deeper into the topics.

The video lectures contain a few very minor mistakes. A list of these mistakes can be found under resources (in the document called ""Errata""). If you think you found an error, report a problem by clicking the square flag at the bottom of the lecture or quiz where you found the error.",5411.0,3892.0,4.7,29.0
Approximation Algorithms Part I,https://www.coursera.org/learn/approximation-algorithms-part-1,Computer Science,Algorithms,Claire Mathieu,"Approximation algorithms, Part I

How efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. 

This course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem. The course content and in particular the homework is of a theoretical nature without any programming assignments.

Arduino y algunas aplicaciones,https://www.coursera.org/learn/arduino-aplicaciones,Computer Science,Design and Product,Yukihiro Minami Koyama,"Arduino es una iniciativa empleada para simplificar el uso de los microcontroladores, que surgió en 2005 como resultado de un proyecto de estudiantes en el Instituto IVREA. Nació con el objetivo de disminuir el costo de los microcontroladores, que entonces los estudiantes empleaban para sus proyectos y que resultaban demasiado costosos. 

Actualmente tiene diferentes usos, como la aplicación de desarrolladores de diseños artísticos e interactivos; de igual forma, muchas personas utilizan Arduino para incursionar en aplicaciones tecnológicas, como la automatización y la robótica.

Su aplicación, aunque pudiera parecer limitada a áreas de la ciencia muy especializadas, es en realidad común, al encontrarla en un cajero automático, un calentador de agua, la pluma de un estacionamiento o las puertas de una plaza o supermercado, y es que este tipo de herramientas, que facilitan nuestra vida diaria, están basadas en un pequeño microcontrolador, cuya tarea está dictada por un programa.

Programar es algo que hacemos día con día al planear nuestras actividades, pero si nos detenemos a organizar aquello que hacemos de manera inconsciente, obtendremos una serie ordenada de pasos que nos llevarán a un objetivo; si tenemos esto claro seremos capaces de planear actividades más complejas.

En este curso utilizaremos Arduino UNO para realizar dos prototipos que muestran el funcionamiento de dispositivos, como un chaleco para ciclista y un pastillero. No es requisito tener conocimientos de programación; sin embargo, conforme avances en el estudio de este curso probablemente necesites reforzar e investigar sobre algunos de los aspectos que aquí se expliquen.

A través de las actividades y material didáctico de este curso aprenderás a aplicar la tarjeta Arduino y podrás adquirir y reforzar nociones básicas de programación, utilizando una herramienta de fácil acceso, que te permitirá además elaborar posteriores proyectos de tu interés.

In asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure.

Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling,Computer Science,Software Development,"Prof. Peter James Stuckey, Prof. Jimmy Ho Man Lee","Optimization is a common form of decision making, and is ubiquitous in our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.

This course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest. This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers.  With access to this advanced technology, problems that are considered inconceivable to solve before will suddenly become easy.

Big-O Time Complexity in Python Code,https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-o-time-complexity-in-python-code,Computer Science,Algorithms,David Dalsveen,"In the field of data science, the volumes of data can be enormous, hence the term Big Data. It is essential that algorithms operating on these data sets operate as efficiently as possible. One measure used is called Big-O time complexity. It is often expressed not in terms of clock time, but rather in terms of the size of the data it is operating on. For example, in terms of an array of size N, an algorithm may take N^2 operations to complete. Knowing how to calculate Big-O gives the developer another tool to make software as good as it can be and provides a means to communicate performance when reviewing code with others.

In the process, you will gain a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, e.g. stack processing, parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management, vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.

This is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the various systems will be given as part of the learning experience. The only prerequisite is knowledge of programming at the level acquired in introduction to computer science courses. All the software tools and materials that are necessary to complete the course will be supplied freely after you enrol in the course.

This course is accompanied by the textbook ""The Elements of Computing Systems"" (Nisan and Schocken, MIT Press). While not required for taking the course, the book provides a convenient coverage of all the course topics. The book is available in either hardcopy or ebook form, and MIT Press is offering a 30% discount off the cover price by using the discount code MNTT30 at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems. 

The course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 15 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling ""nand2tetris TED talk"".

Build a Node Server backend with Express,https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-node-server-backend-express,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,David Dalsveen,"By the end of this project, you will Build a Node Server backend with Express that will fetch data from a MongoDB database.

Often, a dynamic web application is connected to a database on the server side. Node.js serves as the web server used to access the database. Express is a framework for Node.js and acts as middleware to connect the backend Node server to the Client-facing web application. The Client facing web application can then make API (Application Programming Interface) calls to Express to gather data for the dynamic web application.

Build a Persistent Storage App in Android Studio,https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-persistent-storage-app-android-studio,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,Ken Cotter,"In this course you will build an Android app with persistent storage (specifically Shared Preferences) in Android Studio.  What is meant by persistent storage is that when a user exits an app and then restart it, the app will remember some information that the user gave it previously.  This app has four input boxes where the user is being asked to enter a name, address, phone number, and email address. Beneath that section the user will be asked to use radio buttons to indicate the part of the day they prefer, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night.  The ability to save and retrieve information is a fundamental part of practically all apps and is essential knowledge for any aspiring app developer and those who like to create apps out of curiosity for fun.

Build a Python GUI with Tkinter,https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-python-gui-with-tkinter,Computer Science,Software Development,David Dalsveen,"A graphical user interface can be a nice alternative to using the command line for running programs, as there is no need to memorize how to execute a command with arguments. A label may be added to describe what is needed for the application, for example. There are many choices for building a graphical user interface in Python. Some of them require licensing for commercial use and each have their own sets of learning curves. Using Tkinter avoids the licensing issues and is quite simple to use as well. It is a GUI package that is the standard GUI toolkit for python applications and is widely available on multiple platforms including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this course, you will implement a Tkinter GUI to read from a user-provided file containing data.  The GUI will allow the user to plot columnar data as X and Y coordinates on a regression graph, and display statistics about the data from each of the selected columns.

In different parts of the res (resources) directory of your Android Studio project you will put text files, , create strings and all of these will be accessible for all appropriate widgets in your app. This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. Finally, there will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. You will upload an APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io to test the app.

Build an App in Android Studio using onTouch,https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-an-app-in-android-studio-using-ontouch,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,Ken Cotter,"In this project you will build an Android app that that uses onTouch functionality to show certain information when a user clicks (Action Down) on an image, and then have the information change when the user releases (Action Up). The app also creates text files in internal storage when needed, will write to those files, and will read from those files.  The app will interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app). This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with ""Read Review"" on it, and the second with ""Submit Review"" on it.  When the user clicks the ""Read Review"" button a TextView will appear containing a the previously submitted review (if one exists). The user will also be given the option to ""Submit Review"" whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a ""Submit"" button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. When launched the app will also read all information in the review files in internal storage and bring the reviews into the app for use. You will upload an APK of the app to a website called Appetize.io to test the app.

C++ Classes and Objects,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-classes-and-objects,Computer Science,Software Development,David Dalsveen,"In this project you will create an application that defines a Car class and create one to many Car objects using C++.

Object Oriented programming is advantageous because it allows the programmer to think in terms of the way people think of the real world, in terms of Objects like employees, airplanes, and homes for example. In procedural programming, the programmer tends to think more in terms of procedures or functions. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, Classes and Objects are often used interchangeably but there is a distinction between the two. A class is a blueprint for objects. An automobile may come in many different makes, colors, and models, but each car object has those same attributes. A Car class then contains the common attributes all cars have; color, make and model. When an Object of a Car is made from the Car class, it is then assigned a specific color, such as a red Nissan Sentra or a blue Toyota Camry.

The data is then uniquified in a Set data structure and stored in a Map for accessing data by year.

C++'s standard template library or STL contains data structures or containers that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as a Vector can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A List is like a Vector, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Map is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.

The process of making decisions is fundamental in programming, just as it is in real life. A pre-existing condition is evaluated, and a decision is made based on the evaluation. For example, if it is cold outside, a person chooses to wear a coat. If a temperature sensor exceeds a certain threshold, the furnace turns off. In C++, as in other programming languages, a decision construct is used to control the sequence of instructions that are executed under certain conditions. It allows the programmer the power to take certain action based on various input conditions. For example, a grading program will need to assign a certain grade based on a test score.

A hallmark of Object-Oriented programming is code-reuse. Code re-use allows the developer to use tried and tested code, which results in more reliable code and saves in development time as well. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, code re-use can be accomplished in two distinctive ways. One way is to inherit from an existing class by extending its existing functionality. Another common way to re-use code is through aggregation and composition. In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the child class. In composition, the child class depends on its parent for existence.

We describe the fundamentals of imaging, as well as recent innovations in imaging that have had a profound impact on computer vision.

This course starts with examining how an image is formed using a lens camera. We explore the optical characteristics of a camera such as its magnification, F-number, depth of field and field of view. Next, we describe how solid-state image sensors (CCD and CMOS) record images, and the key properties of an image sensor such as its resolution, noise characteristics and dynamic range. We describe how image sensors can be used to sense color as well as capture images with high dynamic range. In certain structured environments, an image can be thresholded to produce a binary image from which various geometric properties of objects can be computed and used for recognizing and locating objects. Finally, we present the fundamentals of image processing – the development of computational tools to process a captured image to make it cleaner (denoising, deblurring, etc.) and easier for computer vision systems to analyze (linear and non-linear image filtering methods).",5399.0,41012.0,4.6,59.0

Combinatorics and Probability,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics,Computer Science,Algorithms,"Владимир Подольский, Alexander S. Kulikov","Counting is one of the basic mathematically related tasks we encounter on a day to day basis. The main question here is the following. If we need to count something, can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.

In this online course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.

One of the main ‘consumers’ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.

In the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.",38300.0,12637.0,4.6,803.0

Cómputo evolutivo,https://www.coursera.org/learn/computo-evolutivo,Computer Science,Algorithms,Katya Rodríguez Vázquez,"La computación evolutiva (evolutionary computation, EC), aplica la teoría de la evolución natural y la genética en la adaptación evolutiva de estructuras computacionales, proporcionando un medio alternativo para atacar problemas complejos en diversas áreas, como la ingeniería, economía, química, medicina y, porque no, las artes. Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población.

Algoritmos evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al cómputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, y mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos, como cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).
Los algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.

Description Design for Interactive Learning Resources,https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources,Computer Science,Design and Product,"Taliesin L. Smith, Emily Moore","This course gives you easy access to an innovative description design framework used and created by experts in description design who design descriptions for highly interactive learning resources.

Interactive learning resources are common, fun, and effective tools that engage learners in the classroom and in remote learning environments. Many of these interactives rely on the visual display. This limits non-visual experiences, and makes many interactive learning resources inaccessible to learners with significant visual impairments or print- and graphics-related disabilities. Descriptions are verbalized text for supporting non-visual access.

This course will show you how to create descriptions, the verbalized text, needed to make interactive learning resources (interactives) accessible to learners who are blind or have a visual impairment (learners with BVI). The course weaves together concepts from inclusive design, web accessibility, and general best practices for description design for non-visual access. The main focus of the course is learning about and using the Description Design Framework created by design researchers at PhET Interactive Simulations. 

Through a series of design tasks, each preempted with examples and demonstrations, the course walks you through how to design descriptions for an interactive of your choosing. While prior experience in web accessibility, interaction design, and description is useful, it is not required for this course. We share many examples from our work, and include tips and design patterns that we have created and actively use to describe our highly interactive science and math simulations. If you have an interest in creating descriptions for interactive learning resources, join us in this course. The Description Design Framework helps us take a methodical approach to the challenging task of designing descriptions for interactives, and we want to share what we know so others can design engaging descriptions that support non-visual access to interactive learning resources.",,,,

Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Practice,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-sdaccel-practice,Computer Science,Design and Product,Marco Domenico Santambrogio,"This course is for anyone passionate about learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!

The more general purpose you are, the more flexible you are and the more kinds of programs and algorithms you can execute on your underlying computing infrastructure. All of this is terrific, but there is no free food and this is happening, quite often, by losing in efficiency.

This course will present several scenarios where the workloads require more performance than can be obtained even by using the fastest CPUs. This scenario is turning cloud and data center architectures toward accelerated computing. Within this course, we are going to show you how to gain benefits by using Xilinx SDAccel to program Amazon EC2 F1 instances. We are going to do this through a working example of an algorithm used in computational biology.

The huge amount of data the algorithms need to process and their complexity raised the problem of increasing the amount of computational power needed to perform the computation. In this scenario, hardware accelerators revealed to be effective in achieving a speed-up in the computation while, at the same time, saving power consumption. Among the algorithms used in computational biology, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment between two strings that could be nucleotides or proteins. In the following classes, we present an analysis and successive FPGA-based hardware acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm used to perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences.

Within this context, this course is focusing on distributed, heterogeneous cloud infrastructures, providing you details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel, through working examples, to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances.",2283.0,,4.4,26.0
Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Theory,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-sdaccel-theory,Computer Science,Design and Product,Marco Domenico Santambrogio,"This course is for anyone passionate in learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!

We are entering in an era in which technology progress induces paradigm shifts in computing!
As a tradeoff between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, we can find a new concept, a new idea of computing... the reconfigurable computing, which has combined the advantages of both the previous worlds. Within this context, we can say that reconfigurable computing will widely, pervasively, and gradually impact human lives. Hence, it is time that we focus on how reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable system design techniques are to be utilised for building applications.

One one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance.
Within this context, the Xilinx SDx tools, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment, and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element, and having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor. 

The out-of-the-box experience will provide interesting and, let us say, “good enough” results for many applications. 
However, this may not be true for you, you may be looking for better performance, data throughput, reduced latency, or to reduce the resources usage... This course is focusing exactly on this. After introducing you to the FPGAs we are going to dig more into the details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel providing you also with working examples on how to optimize the hardware logic to obtain the best of of your hardware implementations. In this case, certain attributes, directives, or pragmas, can be used to direct the compilation and synthesis of the hardware kernel, or to optimise the function of the data mover operating between the processor and the hardware logic.

FPGA computing systems: A Bird’s Eye View,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-computing-systems,Computer Science,Design and Product,Marco Domenico Santambrogio,"Nowadays the complexity of computing systems is skyrocketing. Programmers have to deal with extremely powerful computing systems that take time and considerable skills to be instructed to perform at their best. It is clear that it is not feasible to rely on human intervention to tune a system: conditions change frequently, rapidly, and unpredictably. It would be desirable to have the system automatically adapt to the mutating environment.

This course analyzes the stated problem, embraces a radically new approach, and it introduces how software and hardware systems ca ben adjusted during execution. By doing this, we are going to introduce the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) technologies and how they can be (re)configured.",,2743.0,,
FPGA computing systems: Background knowledge and introductory materials,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-intro,Computer Science,Design and Product,Marco Domenico Santambrogio,"This course is for anyone passionate in learning how a hardware component can be adapted at runtime to better respond to users/environment needs. This adaptation can be provided by the designers, or it can be an embedded characteristic of the system itself. These runtime adaptable systems will be implemented by using FPGA technologies.

Within this course we are going to provide a basic understanding on how the FPGAs are working and of the rationale behind the choice of them to implement a desired system.

This course aims to teach everyone the basics of FPGA-based reconfigurable computing systems. We cover the basics of how to decide whether or not to use an FPGA and, if this technology will be proven to be the right choice, how to program it.
This is an introductory course meant to guide you through the FPGA world to make you more conscious on the reasons why you may be willing to work with them and in trying to provide you the sense of the work you have to do to be able to gain the advantages you are looking for by using these technologies.

We rely on some extra readings to provide more information on the topic covered in this course.
Please NOTE that most of the time, these documents are provided through the IEEE Xplore Digital Library, which means that, to access them, you have to have a valid IEEE subscriptions, either does by yourself or through your university/company.

The course has no prerequisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics and it presents technical topics by using analogizes to help also a student without a technical background to get at least a basic understanding on how an FPGA works.
One of the main objectives of this course is to try to democratize the understanding and the access to FPGAs technologies. FPGAs are a terrific example of a powerful technologies that can be used in different domains. Being able to bring this technologies to domain experts and showing them how they can improve their research because of FPGAs, can be seen as the ultimate objective of this course.

FPGA computing systems: Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration,https://www.coursera.org/learn/copy-of-fpga-intro,Computer Science,Design and Product,Marco Domenico Santambrogio,"New application domains demand ever increasing adaptability and performance. In order to cope with changing user requirements, improvements in system features, changing protocol and data-coding standards, and demands for support of a variety of different user applications, many emerging applications in communication, computing and consumer electronics demand that their functionality stays flexible after the system has been manufactured. Reconfigurable Systems-on-a-Chips (SoCs) employing different microprocessor cores and different types of reconfigurable fabrics are one attractive solution for these domains. The increasing prominence of reconfigurable devices within such systems requires HW/SW co-design for SoCs to address the trade-off between software execution and reconfigurable hardware acceleration. Dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of current reconfigurable devices create an additional dimension in the temporal domain. During the design space exploration phase, overheads associated with reconfiguration and hardware/software interfacing need to be evaluated carefully in order to harvest the full potential of dynamic reconfiguration.

The course will introduce the student with the concept of reconfigurability in FPGAs, presenting the available mechanisms and technologies at the device level and the tools and design methodologies required to design reconfigurable FPGA-based systems. The course will present the different aspects of the design of FPGA-based reconfigurable systems, focusing in particular on dynamically self-reconfigurable systems.

Features and Boundaries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/features-and-boundaries,Computer Science,Algorithms,Shree Nayar,"This course focuses on the detection of features and boundaries in images. Feature and boundary detection is a critical preprocessing step for a variety of vision tasks including object detection, object recognition and metrology – the measurement of the physical dimensions and other properties of objects. The course presents a variety of methods for detecting features and boundaries and shows how features extracted from an image can be used to solve important vision tasks.

We begin with the detection of simple but important features such as edges and corners. We show that such features can be reliably detected using operators that are based on the first and second derivatives of images. Next, we explore the concept of an “interest point” – a unique and hence useful local appearance in an image. We describe how interest points can be robustly detected using the SIFT detector. Using this detector, we describe an end-to-end solution to the problem of stitching overlapping images of a scene to obtain a wide-angle panorama. Finally, we describe the important problem of finding faces in images and show several applications of face detection.",1552.0,9442.0,4.9,14.0

Más recientemente, también se ha popularizado como un lenguaje para desarrollar aplicaciones back-end utilizando node.js, que es un intérprete de JavaScript del lado del servidor. 

JavaScript es un lenguaje no tipado, de scripts y funcional. Los scripts se embeben en una página Web y las instrucciones de ese script las analiza y procesa (o interpreta) el navegador en el momento que deben ser ejecutadas. El hecho de que los programas escritos en JavaScript no se compilen tiene como consecuencia que muchos de los errores que puede cometer el programador, solo se van a detectar en tiempo de ejecución. Esto es más evidente con los errores relacionados con los tipos de datos, por ejemplo: valores incompatibles entre las variables cuando estas se operan; cambios de tipo en las variables; funciones con parámetros que no son recibidos; valores de retorno de las funciones que no son los esperados, entre otros. 

Una alternativa para solucionar estos problemas es TypeScript. Este es un lenguaje de programación, creado por Microsoft, que amplía JavaScript. El lenguaje se ha creado como un proyecto de código abierto, con licencia de Apache License 2.0, por lo que la comunidad de desarrolladores puede usarlo libremente. Entre sus características más notables, es que TypeScript brinda seguridad de tipos de datos a JavaScript. Esta característica permite a los desarrolladores ser muy efectivos e introducir menos errores gracias a que los programas escritos en TypeScript se compilan.

Genome Assembly Programming Challenge,https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes,Computer Science,Algorithms,"Neil Rhodes, Michael Levin, Michael Levin, Pavel  Pevzner, Alexander S. Kulikov","In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen.

To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used GitHub for the project: https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki

The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this online course you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.",35939.0,7064.0,4.5,307.0

Introducción a Java,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduccion-java,Computer Science,Software Development,Elisa Viso Gurovich,"Me llamo Elisa Viso y una de mis pasiones es la de programar y enseñar a programar. 

El lenguaje Java es uno de los que más me ha gustado en mis 45 años que llevo programando. Si bien te podrá parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos básicos verás qué rápido se avanza.
Java, como todos los lenguajes de programación bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con más trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de cómo piensas la solución al problema). 
Pero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extraño, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como tú quieres y obtengas una satisfacción enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.

Este es un curso introductorio a la programación en Java. Como Java es un lenguaje orientado a objetos de propósito general, revisaremos los conceptos básicos del lenguaje como clases e interfaces. Veremos los ingredientes básicos de una clase como constantes y variables, funciones (métodos), y cómo organizar estos ingredientes dentro de una clase. También veremos la utilización de clases de las bibliotecas de Java.

En el primer módulo revisaremos el concepto de orientación a objetos aplicándolo en la vida real.

En el segundo módulo revisamos una herramienta de diseño orientado a objetos, llamada tarjetas de responsabilidades, y a partir de estas últimas diseñamos los encabezados de los distintos servicios que se van a dar, codificándolos en una interfaz.

En el tercer módulo terminaremos la construcción de la clase que corresponde a este problema, aclarando términos comunes en Java, revisando la sintaxis del lenguaje y la autodocumentación con la que cuenta.

En el cuarto módulo utilizaremos lo que ya tenemos para construir una clase más compleja que proporciones arreglos de objetos de la clase que ya tenemos y examinando con bastante profundidad tanto el esquema conceptual de los arreglos como su implementación en el modelo de memoria de Java.

En el quinto y último módulo profundizaremos en el uso de repetición en ejecución y, no puede faltar, los distintos tipos de ejecución condicional que provee el lenguaje.

En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, se proveerá al participante con conocimientos del lenguaje Java que le permitirán resolver una amplia gama de problemas con este lenguaje. Aprenderá a:
•	Plantear la solución de un problema utilizando orientación a objetos.
•	Programar la solución de los problemas utilizando las siguientes características del lenguaje Java:
               -Interfaces y clases
               -Métodos constructores de objetos, de acceso, de actualización, de implementación y auxiliares.
               -Atributos y variables locales de tipos primitivos o de clase.
               -Utilización de clases de biblioteca.
               -Esquemas de ejecución como la repetición y la selección de enunciados

Introduction to UI Design,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui-design,Computer Science,Design and Product,"Loren Terveen, Haiyi Zhu, Lana Yarosh, Dr. Brent Hecht, Joseph A Konstan","In this course, you will gain an understanding of the critical importance of user interface design. You will also learn industry-standard methods for how to approach the design of a user interface and key theories and frameworks that underlie the design of most interfaces you use today.

Through a series of case studies on commercial systems - many of which you likely use on a regular basis - we will illustrate the benefits of good design. We will also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe (in user experience, money, and even human lives).

You will then gain a high-level understanding of the user-interface design process. You will be introduced to common design scenarios - e.g. improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch - and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario.

Finally, we will begin introducing the large body of existing knowledge on design by providing overviews of core user interface design theories and concepts. This key foundational information will help you avoid “reinventing the wheel” when you are designing your interfaces in this specialization.",67449.0,50150.0,4.7,1298.0

Introduction to User Experience Design,https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-design,Computer Science,Design and Product,Dr. Rosa I. Arriaga,"The focus of this course is to introduce the learner to User Experience (UX) Design

User Experience design is design that is user centered. The goal is to design artifacts that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user's needs.

This course is geared toward the novice. It is for learners that have heard about ""user experience"" or ""user interface"" design but don't really know much about these disciplines.

The course mantra is that “Design is a systematic and data driven process.” Design is systematic because it is based on a set of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.

In this course the learner is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.

This means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!",348030.0,279394.0,4.5,7190.0

Loops are used in a Java program whenever a sequence of code must be repeated. A common use for a while loop is to read data from a file, where the file is of unknown length. A for loop, on the other hand is often used when the repeat count of a code sequence is known. A common use of a for loop is to iterate through an array. An Array is a list of items of a fixed size where each entry is the same type of data. The array could contain numbers, Strings of characters, or a user-defined data type.

The data is then uniquified in a Set data structure and stored in a HashMap for accessing data by year.

Java's collections framework contains data structures that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as an ArrayList can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A LinkeList is like an ArrayList, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Hashmap is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.

Code re-use allows the developer to use tried and tested code, which results in more reliable code and saves in development time as well. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as Java, code re-use can be accomplished in two distinctive ways. One way is to inherit from an existing class by extending its existing functionality. A Car class for example can be extended by a Used Car class by adding a parameter to indicate the number of miles on it. Another common way to re-use code is through aggregation and composition. In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the parent class.

Y con el objetivo de darte la capacidad para levantar un servidor e interactuar con la información de entrada y salida del mismo, con lo que posteriormente podrías usar la información que necesites en una página real.

 Node.js es uno de los frameworks de Javascript más utilizados en la actualidad, para ejecutar tu código Javascript en un entorno de ejecución por fuera del navegador y hacerlo sobre el Motor V8 propiedad de Google, que se encarga por nosotros de transformar lo que hicimos a código máquina en lugar de interpretarlo, teniendo mejor rendimiento de esta manera. Y el manejo de información lo podremos usar con un framework llamado “express”, que lo verás en todos los entornos de trabajo reales.

Y todo esto, lo podrás hacer con un mismo lenguaje de programación que podrías utilizar para un frontend, sin embargo, también Node.js lo puedes usar con otros lenguajes además de Javascript, como por ejemplo Python.",,,,

Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile devices, while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism.

Why take this course?

•	All computers are multicore computers, so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism.
•	Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin, Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

•	Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
•	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
•	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
•	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
•	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of multicore Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other parallel programming systems that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., C++11, OpenMP, .Net Task Parallel Library).",39117.0,44580.0,4.6,1149.0

Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/compthinking,Computer Science,Algorithms,Chris Quintana,"Have you ever heard that computers ""think""? Believe it or not, computers really do not think. Instead, they do exactly what we tell them to do. Programming is, ""telling the computer what to do and how to do it.""

Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want to tell the computer to do. Thinking through problems this way is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.

The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation. This project will be completed in stages (and milestones) and will also include a final disaster response plan you'll share with other learners like you.

This course is designed for anyone who is just beginning programming, is thinking about programming or simply wants to understand a new way of thinking about problems critically. No prior programming is needed. The examples in this course may feel particularly relevant to a High School audience and were designed to be understandable by anyone.

You will learn:
-To define Computational Thinking components including abstraction, problem identification, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithms, and evaluating solutions
-To recognize Computational Thinking concepts in practice through a series of real-world case examples
-To develop solutions through the application of Computational Thinking concepts to real world problems",78106.0,91212.0,4.6,1150.0
"Problem Solving, Python Programming, and Video Games",https://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games,Computer Science,Software Development,"Duane Szafron, Paul Lu","This course is an introduction to computer science and programming in Python.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Take a new computational problem and develop a plan to solve it through problem understanding and decomposition.
2.  Follow a design creation process that includes specifications, algorithms, and testing.
3.  Code, test, and debug a program in Python, based on your design.

Important computer science concepts such as problem solving (computational thinking), problem decomposition, algorithms, abstraction, and software quality are emphasized throughout.  The Python programming language and video games are used to demonstrate computer science concepts in a concrete and fun manner.  However, a learner can take the knowledge and skills from this course and apply them to non-game problems, other programming languages, and other computer science courses.

You do not need any previous programming, Python, or video game experience.  However, some computer skills (e.g., mouse, keyboard, document editing), knowledge of algebra, attention to detail (as with many technical subjects), and a “just give it a try” spirit will be keys to your success.  Despite the use of video games for all the programming examples, PVG is not about computer games.  PVG will still provide valuable knowledge and skills for non-game computational problems.

The interactive learning objects (ILO) of the course provide automatic, context-specific guidance and feedback, like a virtual teaching assistant, as you develop problem descriptions, algorithms, and functional test plans.  The course forums will be supported by the creators of the course, to help you succeed.

Python Dynamic HTML Web Server,https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-dynamic-html-web-server,Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,David Dalsveen,"Web application servers are abundant these days. Each have one thing in common, they ultimately process requests and return web pages. Apache serves PHP pages along with static HTML. Microsoft’s .NET creates dynamic web pages that may be authored using C# or VB and served using IIS. Java Enterprise Edition has many options, WebSphere, WebLogic, and Apache TomEE to name a few server platforms. 
Python has its own web server that can be built in one line of code, but it is relatively simple to create the server code yourself. This is useful if you want to understand how web servers work and can be used to quickly test your own web pages. In addition, some browsers will not load local files due to security; using a simple web server solves this issue as well.

In this course, you will create a Python application in which you will create a simple HTTP server, create a static web page, create dynamic pages using python, and access the pages from the server using the command line as well as from a browser.

Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-formal-modeling-1,Computer Science,Software Development,"Dr.ir. Pieter Cuijpers, Anne Remke","Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   

After finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.

Disclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.

This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.",7949.0,3398.0,4.4,42.0
Quantitative Model Checking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-model-checking,Computer Science,Software Development,Anne Remke,"The integration of ICT (information and communications technology) in different applications is rapidly increasing in e.g. Embedded and Cyber physical systems, Communication protocols and Transportation systems. Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).

First, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. 

Model checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes
the functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.
The main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:

- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .
- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.
- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.",5656.0,2971.0,4.2,50.0

In this one-hour, project-based course, we will cover the second principle of ""SOLID"" programming: Open-Closed Principle (""OCP"") states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. It sounds like a contradiction, but it will allow us to add functionality to our sample game without touching existing code. In the project, we will create some ""typical"" code that is fairly common in game-development, and then restructure it to become compliant with OCP.

This project is part two of a five-part series on SOLID Programming principles, which are:

 - Single Responsibility
 - Open-Closed (this guided project)
 - Liskov's Substitution
 - Interface Segregation
 - Dependency Inversion

Each of these guided projects stands on its own, but for a full understanding of good coding practices, completing all five guided projects (in order) is recommended.",,,,

System Validation: Automata and behavioural equivalences,https://www.coursera.org/learn/automata-system-validation,Computer Science,Design and Product,Jan Friso Groote,"Have you ever experienced software systems failing? Websites crash, calendar not synchronising, or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system, the impact of software failures can be huge, even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software, and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems, is very complex and very difficult to get right. However, we _need_ dependability in the systems we use, directly or indirectly, to support us in our everyday lives.

System Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. 

This first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences', builds the foundation of the subsequent courses, showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward, but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise, reliable and maintainable software.

Use AI Builder and Power Apps to Process Invoice Data,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-ai-builder-power-apps-process-invoice-data,Computer Science,Software Development,Daniel Gregurić,"What's the quickest and most efficient way of keeping track of incoming invoices? A company accounting department usually keeps data on business expenses in lists where employees manually enter invoice data such as invoice number, invoice date, due date, total amount etc. It's a time-consuming and error-prone process, but thankfully, it can be automated with AI Builder and Power Apps or Power Automate. 

In this 60-minutes long guided project, “Use AI Builder and Power Apps to Process Invoice Data”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, build and train AI Builder model for processing invoice data and create a Power Apps application which will use that model and AI builder to read data from invoices and save it to the created SharePoint list. Of course, that Power App application can be shared with colleagues so they can upload invoices from their devices or take a photo of them directly. All we need to do is take our phone, open the application, upload the document, or take a photo of the invoice and let the Power App and AI builder do the rest. Is that a great improvement of a business process or what? The best thing about SharePoint, AI Builder and Power Apps is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background. We don’t need to be familiar with any programming language, basic knowledge of Excel-like formulas is enough for completing this project.

Version Control with Git,https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git,Computer Science,Software Development,Steve Byrnes,"The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. 

In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently ""know just enough Git to be dangerous"". 

There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)

You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. 

This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). 

This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.",102810.0,70851.0,4.7,2716.0

ENGLISH VERSION

We have all probably played a video game at least once in our life, but... what's behind them? We can say that -no matter what game it is- there's a difficult multidisciplinary work that involves factors that go from the design to the video game's programming. This is an introductory course that will show you which aspects we must consider in the video game, and it will subsequently help you to individually study the different videogames creation's nucleus: design, art, video game engine and gameplay.

Visual Communication through zines using Scribus & Issuu.com,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-communication-through-zines,Computer Science,Design and Product,Martina Cipolletti,"By the end of this project, you will learn how to use Scribus to create a short digital zine. Scribus v 1.4.8 is a desktop publishing software which is currently providing a valid Open Source alternative to the mainstream desktop publishing software, such as Indesign. It is a valuable option for those who want to broaden their software knowledge and train their skillset in terms of editorial production practising with this free tool available to be downloaded to any desktop. Digital zines are the current evolution of traditional zines, both recognised as powerful tools of Visual Communication. Originally born as a form of self-expression, zines are characterised by small-circulation and self-publishing, peculiarities that give traditional zines a distinctive “Lo-Fi” aesthetic. Their contents can be original or appropriated texts and images. Zines aim to divulge art, cultural or social issues, abstract concepts or in the case of “fanzines” to talk about specific phenomena of which the authors are enthusiasts. Having a wider circulation due to the fact that they can be printed or shared online, Digital zines nowadays keep the purposes of traditional ones plus they are largely used as digital portfolios for practitioners or companies, event and product catalogues, instructional or educational manuals, marketing and editorial material. As a starting point to explore the potentialities of digital zines, the learners can become familiar with this form of Visual Communication, in order to reach a broader public to whom they share their contents.",,,,
Visual Perception,https://www.coursera.org/learn/perception,Computer Science,Algorithms,Shree Nayar,"The ultimate goal of a computer vision system is to generate a detailed symbolic description of each image shown. This course focuses on the all-important problem of perception. 

We first describe the problem of tracking objects in complex scenes. We look at two key challenges in this context. The first is the separation of an image into object and background using a technique called change detection. The second is the tracking of one or more objects in a video. Next, we examine the problem of segmenting an image into meaningful regions. In particular, we take a bottom-up approach where pixels with similar attributes are grouped together to obtain a region. 

Finally, we tackle the problem of object recognition. We describe two approaches to the problem. The first directly recognize an object and its pose using the appearance of the object. This method is based on the concept of dimension reduction, which is achieved using principal component analysis. The second approach is to use a neural network to solve the recognition problem as one of learning a mapping from the input (image) to the output (object class, object identity, activity, etc.). We describe how a neural network is constructed and how it is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.",,4568.0,,

面向对象技术高级课程（The Advanced Object-Oriented Technology）,https://www.coursera.org/learn/aoo,Computer Science,Algorithms,"蒋 严冰, 邵 维忠","如果将软件开发人员看作行走江湖的武侠，那么各种软件开发技术就是武侠赖以傍身的武术秘籍。有的秘籍以易学灵巧见长，练习者很快掌握，并有立竿见影的功效，但失之厚重持久；有的秘籍初学乍练顿显困难，虽冥思苦解仍不得要领，需坚持不断的内功修炼方成正果，却是成为武林大侠必备的至宝。本课程有些类似于后者。

《面向对象技术高级课程》深入、系统、完整地讲解当今主流的面向对象软件开发方法的分析、设计、实现及重构方法，深入讲解UML语言的高级技术细节，以及近年来面向对象方法最新的发展趋势。课程集百家之所言，并结合主讲者最新的研究成果，并通过大量、丰富、完整、不同领域、应用不同技术的案例将其中的关键知识点串联起来，便于理解和应用。

本课程并不拘限于某一特定的面向对象的编程语言的编程技巧，但却包含了基于当前主流的面向对象编程语言的多项完整案例。本课程引导选课同学从更为抽象和共性的模型角度描述现实世界和软件世界,即构建分析与设计模型，之后再将其落实到软件编程实现。这种工程化的理念对于开发大型、复杂、困难、攸关软件系统是非常必要的，也是作为高级程序员、系统分析师、软件架构师等高级软件技术职位所必需具有的素质。

作为一门面向广大受众的中文MOOC课程，本次课程力求向不同需求和背景的朋友呈现中华文化氛围、生动有趣的案例、跨专业的广阔的视野、以及深入实用的技术综合。

同时作为一门传授软件专门知识的MOOC课程，本次课程将为具有编程能力的同学带来有趣的软件开发项目作业，在实际的软件开发中感受学以致用的快乐，体会面向对象方法学的深刻内涵。

本次课程仍将邀请面向对象领域著名学者北京大学信息科学技术学院邵维忠教授和麻志毅副教授讲解某些章节，并对面向对象方法学中的某些关键问题进行讨论。",4668.0,6941.0,4.5,12.0
