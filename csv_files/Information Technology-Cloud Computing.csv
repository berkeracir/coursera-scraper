Can you imagine all that paperwork and having to chase your manager across the office to approve each car rental request? Thankfully, with technology we can put many manual processes under control and automate almost everything.

This intermediate-level guided project, “Automate Approval Process with SharePoint & Power Automate” is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of a business approval process and has some prior knowledge of Excel formulas.

In this Intermediate-level guided project, you will create a SharePoint site and lists, and use Power Automate to automate approval process for car rental requests by employees. You will also make a calendar which will show when the cars are rented out, and you will learn to create flows that send reminders to the managers. What’s great about SharePoint and Power Automate is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background!

Employees spend a lot of time chasing those responsible colleagues all over the company or sending them multiple emails to remind them about the documents waiting to be checked. 

For example, a junior business analyst creates a business offer document and of course, it needs to be reviewed and approved by a senior business analyst, a CEO, or another superior. You can imagine how exhausting and time consuming it can be for the employee to find the corresponding colleague and get the wanted feedback on the document, or to send them repetitive emails each morning reminding them about it. Thankfully, we can leverage Power Automate and SharePoint functionalities and automate the whole process after the document is created. An employee will just create the document, upload it to the SharePoint document library and Power Automate will handle the rest automatically. This might be a huge timesaver for the employee since they don’t need to chase colleagues or send them emails anymore.

This Guided Project ""Automate Doc Review Process with SharePoint & Power Automate"" is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of document or report approval.

Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-building-modern-net-applications,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,"Russell Sayers, Seph Robinson, Morgan Willis","In modern cloud native application development, it’s oftentimes the goal to build out serverless architectures that are scalable, are highly available, and are fully managed. This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS. 

Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application. 	`

Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API. 

Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.

Cloud Cost Management: Optimization Strategies,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-cost-management-optimization-strategies,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Morgan Willis,"Cloud cost management is the organizational planning that allows an enterprise to understand and manage the costs and needs associated with its cloud technology. In particular, this means finding cost-effective ways to maximize cloud usage and efficiency. AWS has a set of services, tools and resources to help the customers with cost management and optimization. This course will highlight the solutions and best practices to get started with optimizing AWS cost and capacity.

For effective cost control in cloud computing services, it is quite important to analyze and manage cloud cost and leverage cloud cost management tools to help discover the cause(s) of these inefficiencies. Unplanned cloud costs are frequently the result of lack of visibility about the current consumption patterns and past trends, nonstandard deployments that come from unclear or absent development processes, poor organization, or the absence of automated deployment and configuration tools. By contrast with on-premise infrastructure, which is financed by fixed upfront investments, cloud consumption is an everyday operational expense. This requires a huge shift in your approach to operational management, where optimizing cloud cost is as important as optimizing performance.

A well-defined cost optimization framework helps establish cloud budget, design standards and best practices to follow that budget, and employ cloud solutions that support the organization’s financial goals.",,4172.0,4.6,14.0

Containerized Applications on AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/containerized-applications-on-aws,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,"Morgan Willis, Russell Sayers","This course introduces you to container technologies and how they can be used to modernize your applications, as well as exploring how different AWS services can be used to manage and orchestrate those containers.

Container technologies have existed for years, and are still gaining popularity. Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?

AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.

This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",5607.0,46423.0,4.7,49.0

Process Data with Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Cosmo DB,https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data-with-microsoft-azure-synapse-link-for-cosmo-db,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Brendan McKeown,"In the past, performing traditional analytical workloads with Azure Cosmos DB has been a challenge. ETL mechanisms to migrate data from Cosmos DB to platforms more suited to performing analytics on data exist, but are a challenge to develop and maintain.
Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB addresses the needs to perform analytics over our transactional data without impacting our transactional workloads. 
This is made possible through the Azure Cosmos DB Analytical store, which allows us to sync our transactional data into an isolated column store without us having to develop and manage complex ETL jobs, providing us with near real-time analytical capability on our data. In this project we will step through the process of configuring the services and process data using the Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Cosmo DB.

Moreover, do you have the time to screen and read each job applicant’s email? How can you efficiently filter all candidate emails and forward qualified applicants to hiring committees? 
In this beginner-level guided project ""Process Forms with AI Model in Power Automate"", we will use a pre-created job application form and create a model that will extract data from the form. We will then train the model with a couple of patterns, and create a flow that will use the model when candidate emails arrive. Consequently, when we receive a job application by email, the application will go through the flow and, if the candidate meets desired requirements, forward the email to the supervisor.

The requirement for this project is having a Microsoft developer program account, but don’t worry, you will be given instructions on how to get it right here.

Two Major Models of running containers in AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/two-major-models-of-running-containers-in-aws,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Ann Kovattil,"Welcome to this Project about “Two Major Models of running Containers in AWS”. This Project will be focusing on one of the many types of computing in AWS, called “Container Computing”. To understand the benefits of AWS Products and services, which relates to Containers, you need to understand what ‘Containers’ are and what benefits ‘Container Computing’ Provides. In this Project, you are going to get a chance to make a ‘Container’. 
If you are looking to deploy applications across multiple machines and platforms, Containers and virtual machines (VMs) are two of the top approaches in use today. Both can help your IT team become more agile and responsive to business demands. Both are used to host applications. Before containers came along, the “virtual machine” was the technology of choice for optimizing server capacity, but Virtual Machines had some drawbacks.
I f you run a virtual machine, say with 4 GB RAM and 4 GB disk, the operating system can easily consume 60 - 70% of the disk and much of the available memory, leaving relatively little for application which run in those Virtual Machine. But Containerization handles things in a different way. Instead of running a whole ‘operating System’ for each application, containers run as a process. So if you could run 5 applications using ‘Virtualization’, you will be able to run 15 applications using ‘Containerization’. 

This Project will help you to learn different ways of running “containers” in AWS. There are two different ways to run “containers” in AWS. One is using “EC2 instance” and other using “ECS Fargate”.So this Project has two major parts. In the first part, you will learn to create a docker image and test that image by running on a container, and once you verified your docker image works, you are going to upload it to “DockerHub”, which is a popular online resource for uploading docker images for others to access, either public or specific private individuals.In the second part of this project, you will learn to create an ECS cluster with Fargate cluster mode, and will deploy the container we created, into Fargate Cluster. So you are going to get some practical experience of how to deploy real container into a Fargate Cluster.

There is a lot to get through though. so let’s get started!!
Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",,,,

Use Power Automate & SharePoint to Automate Invoice Sending,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-power-automate-sharepoint-automate-invoice-sending,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Each company must produce invoices for their services and each invoice must be delivered to the client. Most companies have employees who are doing both tasks manually, first they create an invoice and then they send it by email to the customer. As with most other repetitive tasks, we can use Power Automate and SharePoint to automate one of those 2 tasks and that is, sending invoices by email. We just need to set up some rules, set up a SharePoint site as our data source and implement a Power Automate flow which will handle the process.

In this 40-minutes long guided project, “Use Power Automate & SharePoint to Automate Invoice Sending”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, set up a document library and create a Power Automate flow which will automate the sending of invoices to the customers. Of course, you can allow other colleagues to access and use this SharePoint site so they will be able to use your implementation as well. In the end, you won’t need to send emails to the customers manually, all you will have to do is create an invoice, name it correctly and upload it to the SharePoint document library and the Power Automate flow will do the rest. 

Since this project uses Office 365 services like SharePoint and Power Apps (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.",,,,
Use Process Advisor to Analyze and Automate Manual Process,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-process-advisor-analyze-automate-manual-process,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Imagine working in a car rental company that manually tracks which cars are rented out and which ones are ready for rental. As employees, we are responsible for informing all other employees about available cars each day and we are performing a repetitive process each day: we have to open SharePoint, find a site and Excel file, download the file, open it in Excel, filter out available cars, export it as PDF and send it by email to other colleagues who are responsible for car rentals, so they know which cars can be offered to the customers. Of course, this process is time consuming, and we don’t know which part of that process can be automated or how to automate it.

Thankfully, with Power Automate Process Advisor, not only can we see where the bottlenecks are and what can be automated, but we can also get a recommendation for which actions a Power Automate flow could be used for achieving the wanted automatization of this business process. With that, we can easily give machines to handle the repetitive process and spend our time on other business tasks. So, from 7 manual steps which must be done each day, we will end up with only 1 manual step, triggering the flow which we will create. How cool is that? 
 
This Guided Project "" Use Process Advisor to Analyze and Automate Manual Process"" is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of manual business process. In the project you will create a SharePoint site and a list (from a sample Excel file), and learn how to use Power Automate Process Advisor to analyze the manual process. You will also create a flow with the guidance of the Process Advisor analysis result. What’s great about SharePoint and Power Automate is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background!

Since this project uses Office 365 services (SharePoint, Excel, Outlook) and Power Automate (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.
