"""Making"" Progress Teach-Out",https://www.coursera.org/learn/makingprogress,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Pablo Palomino,"What is “progress”? How do we decide when we’re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are—in your city, community, or neighborhood—and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.

Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans—our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. 

This Teach-Out will ask the following questions:
•	What are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? 
•	How do people connect with places in our modern cities? 
•	Do places progress? 
•	How can we measure in them whether there is any “progress”? 

We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.

A Teach-Out is: 
– an event – it takes place over a fixed, short period of time 
– an opportunity – it is open for free participation to everyone around the world 
– a community – it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals 
– a conversation – an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people 

This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory’s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. 

Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!",2063.0,,,

After the Arab Spring – Democratic Aspirations and State Failure,https://www.coursera.org/learn/after-the-arab-spring,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Dr. Ebrahim Afsah,"Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.

The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.

Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?

This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead “has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.” This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

"Agriculture, Economics and Nature",https://www.coursera.org/learn/agriculture-economics-nature,Social Sciences,Economics,"Professor David Pannell, BSc(Agric), BEc, PhD","Sound economic thinking is crucial for farmers because they depend on good economic decision making to survive. Governments depend on economic information to make good policy decisions on behalf of the community. This course will help you to contribute to better decision making by farmers, or by agencies servicing agriculture, and it will help you to understand why farmers respond to policies and economic opportunities in the ways they do. 

You can use this course to improve your skills and knowledge and to assess whether this is a subject that you'd like to study further. The course includes high-quality video lectures, interviews with experts, demonstrations of how to build economic models in spreadsheets, practice quizzes, and a range of recommended readings and optional readings. Assessment is by quizzes and a final exam. 

The key economic principles that we’ll learn about can help us understand changes that have occurred in agriculture, and support improved decision making about things like agricultural production methods, agricultural input levels, resource conservation, and the balance between agricultural production and its environmental impacts. 

There are literally thousands of agricultural economists around the world who work on these issues, so there is a wealth of knowledge to draw on for the course.

Next, we focus on some of the roles of animals in human entertainment with particular attention to dog fighting and zoos. Finally, we investigate animal health and welfare through the lens of dilemmas in veterinary medicine and decisions in animal shelters.",2045.0,4196.0,4.8,40.0
"Animals, Self, and Society",https://www.coursera.org/learn/animals-self-society,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Leslie Irvine,"This course explores how animals and people are situated within the web of structures and connections known as “society.” Module 1 considers some of the key symbolic roles that animals play in society by investigating the practice of “thinking with animals.” We investigate how people construct different meanings of animals and the implications these meanings have for both animals and humans. You will gain first-hand experience of this by analyzing how animals are represented in the media. Modules 2 and 3 investigate human-animal relationships, including those that involve suffering as well as those that are beneficial. Although many people describe their pets as friends or family members, Module 2 takes a deeper dive into what constitutes friendship and family membership where other species are concerned. Module 3 examines the dark side of these relationships, focusing on animal abuse and its relationship to domestic violence. Module 4 focuses on people’s encounters with those animals outside the boundaries of the home and the farm. The way people understand and regard the species commonly considered “wild” shapes the treatment and moral status of these animals.",3869.0,6825.0,4.7,86.0
Anti-Racism I,https://www.coursera.org/learn/antiracism-1,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Shawn, Jennifer","Anti-Racism I is an introduction to the topic of race and racism in the United States. The primary audience for this course is anyone who is interested in learning about race/racism in the US who has never taken a course in critical race or ethnic studies or affiliated fields (indeed, who may not know what the fields of critical race studies or ethnic studies are), who has never read a book about race/racism, or attended any race equity or diversity trainings on the topic of race/racism.

In this course you will learn how to:

- Use and comprehend contemporary intersectional terminology through a provided glossary
- Critically discuss “whiteness”
- Recognize the concept of White privilege that all White people have whether they want that privilege or not and to differentiate between White supremacy as a systemic concept vs. White supremacists (who are professional racists like the KKK).
- Distinguish between being not racist and being anti-racist
- Define systemic and institutional racism 
- Accept the unequal history of race and racism in the United States that has created racial hierarchies that has disenfranchised Black Americans
- Share with others the true foundations of United States’s histories beginning with the acknowledgement of settler colonialism and the rewards that White people have received due to White supremacy and Black oppression.
- Talk about race and racism
- Explain why phrases like “All Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” are racist
- Recognize that anyone can be anti-racist--it only takes the dedication and decision to be anti-racist, to educate yourself about the history of racism in the US and then to talk in an anti-racist way and to act as an anti-racist

Anti-Racism II,https://www.coursera.org/learn/antiracism-2,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Jennifer, Shawn","Anti-Racism II is an intermediate course between Anti-Racism I and Anti-Racism III, focusing on the topic of race, racism, and strategies regarding how to be an anti-racist. Anti-Racism II is for anyone who has previously taken Anti-Racism I, or who has basic knowledge of the racial issues plaguing the United States, and globally.

Anti-Racism I focused upon how to have open dialogue and conversations about race and racism. Anti-Racism II takes on the vital role assisting students in guiding their own conversations regarding race, and additionally gender and sexuality. Anti-Racism II will expand your knowledge and critically engage your inquiry, centering upon short interviews with leading scholars and activists in the field.   Coupled with supplementary video and reading material, these interviews will further demonstrate the power of open dialogue and self-narration, directing you towards being an anti-racist ally. The centrality of the course interviews will culminate in a final project where students will construct and carry out their own personalized interview. The final project will test dialogic skills while asserting the importance of intimate conversations about race, gender, and sexuality. 

This is challenging work in troubling times that may conjure uneasy feelings and emotions. Anti-Racism II can work as a bridge coming face to face with your personal individual relationship with social demands plaguing us nationally and globally. The remedy is to allow yourself uncomfortableness in order to get to the solutions. We are all in this together.

Peace & Love

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education for Teachers,https://www.coursera.org/learn/artificial-intelligence-education-for-teachers,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr Anne Forbes, Dr Markus Powling","Today’s learners need to know what artificial intelligence (AI) is, how it works, how to use it in their everyday lives, and how it could potentially be used in their future. Using AI requires skills and values which extend far beyond simply having knowledge about coding and technology.

This course is designed by teachers, for teachers, and will bridge the gap between commonly held beliefs about AI, and what it really is. AI can be embedded into all areas of the school curriculum and this course will show you how. 

This course will appeal to teachers who want to increase their general understanding of AI, including why it is important for learners; and/or to those who want to embed AI into their teaching practice and their students’ learning.

Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-ethics,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Maria Hedlund, Lena Lindström, Erik Persson","Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges is a four-week course that explores ethical and societal aspects of the increasing use of artificial intelligent technologies (AI). The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society. 

The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.

In the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? 

Next, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.

A further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by “conscious”? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. 

In the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? 

The last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?

At the end of the course, you will have 
·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, 
·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, 
·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts ‘intelligence’ and ‘consciousness’ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness, 
·      a basic understanding of the concepts of ‘forward-looking’ and ‘backward-looking responsibility’ and an acquaintance with problems connected to applying these concepts on AI, 
·      a basic understanding of the control problem in AI and acquaintance with commonly discussed solutions to this problem, 
·      and an ability to discuss and reflect upon the ethical and societal aspects of these issues.",1706.0,5754.0,4.5,31.0

Assessment for Learning,https://www.coursera.org/learn/assessmentforlearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.

This course, “Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,” is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrack® Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. 

Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we’ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world’s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the world’s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.
2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the world’s most pressing problems.
3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems. 
5. Apply skills learned to implement solutions.",18256.0,59516.0,4.7,544.0
Blended Learning: Personalizing Education for Students,https://www.coursera.org/learn/blending-learning-personalization,Social Sciences,Education,"Brian Greenberg, Rob Schwartz, Michael  Horn","Plenty of buzz exists about blended learning and its transformational potential. But what does blended learning really mean? In this course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools. Specifically, we will look at these issues through the lens of three high-performing schools that each use a different type of blended learning.  A few of the key topics will include:

- The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning
- Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role
- Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data
- Implementation challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions

We will live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding and skip material they already know. Overall, we will take a hand-on approach and the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended learning model.

This course is designed to help an investor, businessperson or economist approach macroeconomic, institutional and international data and derive information from the indicators that point to the types of opportunities and risks that they present.  Students will gain practice by handling the data of some of the largest economies in the world –the United States, Japan, the European Union, China and India—and “reading the story” of their economies from their data, yielding surprisingly profound conclusions about their present and future. The course is the third in a series for the specialization but it is also a stand-alone course for anyone who wants practice in practical macroeconomics.

This course includes 4 modules, each one deep-diving into the macroeconomic circumstances that have been brought up in the recent history of four key regions: the USA, Japan, Europe, and China and India.  Students will analyze the ways in which international economies relate with one another, the benefits of trade and migration and economic development and how it occurs, among other themes.  

Professor Allard takes overarching macroeconomic theory and turns it into a practical tool for those interested in the opportunities and risks of investment and doing business in each of the four regions covered.",7743.0,7191.0,4.8,145.0

Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course – given by specialists in the field – goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.  It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes célèbres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice.

Chinese Politics Part 1 – China and Political Science,https://www.coursera.org/learn/chinesepolitics1,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,David Zweig,"This course offers a conceptual framework for understanding China that highlights the intersection of politics and economics. It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 – China and the World.

More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected China’s internal development. We then look at various aspects of China’s “going out strategy” — its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of China’s opening to the outside world.

Cities are back in town : sociologie urbaine pour un monde globalisé,https://www.coursera.org/learn/developpement-urbain,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Patrick Le Galès,"La mondialisation et l'européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des villes à travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? 

Pour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....
Les questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.

Cities are back in town : sociología urbana para un mundo globalizado,https://www.coursera.org/learn/desarrollo-urbano,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Patrick Le Galès,"Acerca del curso

Los procesos de globalización y europeización respaldan el rápido desarrollo de las ciudades en distintas partes del mundo. En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como ""posmetrópolis"", ""ciudades globales"" y ""ciudades-regiones globales"". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? 
Por el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.
Los asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.

General Overview Help Center

Urbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.
Globalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? 
For the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....
Classic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.

This principle, part of the Rule of Law, has come to represent the powerful idea that even politicians and monarchs are bound by the law. However in an age of powerful corporations, international cyber-crime and popular support for authoritarian leaders, the Rule of Law is under threat worldwide.

This course, run by the Bingham Centre of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, will provide an introduction to headline issues around the Rule of Law. Each week we will tackle aspects of the Rule of Law and discuss how they are impacted by current events. The course will use video lectures, recommended reading, discussion questions and activities to enable you to develop your own perspective on the Rule of Law. Though this course sits at the intersection of law and politics, participants do not require any formal educational background in either of these subjects to join.

And what rights can you, as an individual, exercise under data protection law? If you’d like to find out, then this course is for you!

First, we’ll look at how the European Union’s ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (‘GDPR’) regulates the processing of personal data in cloud services. You’ll learn to identify controllers and processors, describe their roles and responsibilities, and understand how cloud customers and providers can comply in practice.
 
Second, we’ll look at international transfers of personal data. We’ll explain how the GDPR can apply to cloud providers and their customers anywhere in the world, as well as how restrictions on international transfers apply to cloud services.
 
Third, we’ll look at how the Network and Information Security (‘NIS’) Directive regulates the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. You’ll learn to identify cloud providers’ duties to notify security breaches and to keep their services secure, and how to apply those duties to concrete case studies.

Estas son algunas de las preguntas que podrás ir respondiendo a lo largo del recorrido de las tres semanas que te propone este curso de introducción al estudio de la cognición, el pensamiento y el lenguaje. 
Nuestro curso comienza con el estudio de los procesos psicológicos básicos y la perspectiva cognitiva. En la primera semana, focalizaremos en presentar el estudio de los procesos básicos en psicología: ¿qué hay en la mente y cómo funciona? En primer lugar, destacaremos el abordaje empírico a los procesos mentales. Luego, expondremos la perspectiva cognitiva: la mente como procesador de información. ¿Qué significa la analogía entre la mente y una computadora (y qué no)? Finalmente, delinearemos los principales abordajes de estudio que van dando forma a la psicología cognitiva.
En la segunda semana, nuestro tema principal será la memoria y el pensamiento. ¿Cómo funciona la mente cuando tenemos que llegar a una conclusión en un razonamiento, tomar una decisión, resolver un problema o asignar causas a un hecho? Para eso, en primer lugar, vamos a presentar un modelo de sistemas de memoria, cuál es su función, cuáles son sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan. Luego, vamos a abordar el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento. ¿Qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada? ¿Y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática? Finalmente, vamos a revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.
En la última semana, nos dedicaremos a estudiar qué sucede en la mente cuando hablamos o entendemos lenguaje. ¿Cómo es el procesamiento entre que tenemos una idea y la expresamos en una serie de sonidos o gráficos, llamados “letras”? ¿Y cómo es el procesamiento entre que escuchamos una serie de sonidos o vemos unos gráficos y nos hacemos una idea mental del contenido? En este módulo, plantearemos el campo de la psicolingüística y nos detendremos en los procesos de comprensión y producción. Al final veremos algunos procesos y estudios experimentales dentro de la comprensión del lenguaje.

Objetivos del curso:
• Comprender a la psicología de los procesos básicos como una disciplina científica.
• Entender la analogía entre la mente y una computadora, y qué es un modelo en términos de arquitectura funcional.
• Dar cuenta de las perspectivas que confluyen en la psicología cognitiva y su relevancia para ella: la psicología experimental, los modelos computacionales, la neuropsicología cognitiva, la neurociencia cognitiva.
• Comprender un modelo de sistemas de memoria: su papel en la cognición, sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan.
• Entender el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento.
• Entender qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada, y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática.
• Revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.
• Comprender el planteo del lenguaje humano como un sistema formal estructurado y reglado en el origen del abordaje cognitivo en psicolingüística.
• Comprender el campo de estudio y abordaje de la psicolingüística cognitiva.
• Comprender algunos de los procesos intervinientes en la comprensión del lenguaje y algunos de los estudios experimentales sobre este.",2588.0,42927.0,4.7,81.0

Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World,https://www.coursera.org/learn/muslim-world,Social Sciences,Law,Dr. Ebrahim Afsah,"Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.

Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.
This course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Three common themes will characterise the course: 

We privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. 

We seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. 

We seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. 

Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.",34037.0,6125.0,4.8,659.0

Contemporary India,https://www.coursera.org/learn/india,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Anthony D'Costa,"This course presents some important vignettes of a complex, highly diverse India that is also witnessing unprecedented changes since its formal independence in 1947 from Great Britain. The lectures revolve around social dimensions of change, the continuing influence of ancient texts on contemporary India, political democracy, economic transition from the state to the market, gender relations, India's economic globalisation and changing world view.

While one of the objectives is to capture the multifaceted process of change, the course also critically examines some of the tensions inherent in these changes. For example, how does gender inequality play itself out in a changing Indian society, how do the modernist conceptions of art entailing market valuation challenge the more socio-centric values found in South India, what are the politics linguistic identities, and how might India address its myriad development challenges such as poverty and unemployment.

No specific prior knowledge is required. However, it would be helpful if students are aware of the socio political dynamics at play in contemporary India and keep themselves abreast with current affairs and debates in the country to fully appreciate the various dimensions and contours if the subject matter in the course.

This course is taught in English.

Then, on behalf of the University of Antwerp, Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Gdańsk, University of Luxembourg and Tilburg University, we would like to welcome you to this MOOC on Cross-border Road Transport in EU law context. This MOOC is a part of the Erasmus + Project funded by the European Commission. In this MOOC, you will not only learn what the current legal framework is, but also, how it is applied in the road transport sector.

After participating in this MOOC, you will be able to: 

1. Describe the basics of the process of European integration, in the light of the affirmation of the four fundamental freedoms 
of the EU, European framework on private international law, the posting of workers, social security coordination and social dialogue.
2. Understand the interplay between Treaty provisions and secondary sources in the relevant fields.
3. Understand the frictions between the rationales underneath the legal provisions that govern EU social policy and labour law.
4. Analyse the most relevant case law of the European Court of Justice with an impact on the rights of international road transport workers.
5. Familiarise with official documents of the EU institutions and with academic and other relevant literature in this field.
6. Use, where relevant, the implementation of EU rules by Member States.
7. Solve cases dealing with the implementation of the applicable legal provisions.

We are offering you knowledge clips, memoranda that contain in-depth legal information on the different key topics, recommended readings and case law. Next to that after each module, you could test your acquired knowledge by taking a multiple choice test. In the end of this course, you will be able to apply everything you have learned in a practical manner by solving our sample guide case that resembles a real life scenario which challenges you to deal with everyday's problems faced in the cross-border road transport by practitioners in the field. 

By participating in this MOOC, you will find answers to the following questions:

1. Which of the four fundamental freedoms is applicable?
2. Which court has jurisdiction over a labour dispute and which law governs the cross-border employment relation?
3. How to apply and enforce the rules stemming from the Posting of Workers Directive?  
4. Which social security system is applicable and which social security institution is competent to levy the social security contributions? 
5. What is the role of social partners in the cross-border road transport?

In the end it all makes SENSE! So let's go down this road together. Buckle up!",2940.0,2095.0,,
Cultural impact of housing displacement gentrification,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cultural-impact-of-housing-displacement-gentrification,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Dr Craig Gurney,"This course provides an introduction to gentrification and to the cultural impacts of housing displacement for people in cities and neighbourhoods across the world.   Gentrification is a term which has been used to describe the process by which wealthier people move into an area leading to the displacement of poorer groups who are priced out of the area by increases in rents and housing prices.  It is usually associated with physical improvements to the housing stock and to changes in local shops and services.   Sometimes it is closely associated with the displacement of black people by white people.  Gentrification is never neutral in its effects.  Places change.  They look and feel different and different people live there.

There are winners and losers, incomers and those displaced, all of whom are caught up in a process by which the social status of an area can often change beyond recognition.   Gentrification is both a social and a spatial process.  It is not surprising therefore to find that most people who have written about gentrification are either sociologists or geographers.  

In this course we will learn how the term gentrification originated and the way in which the term has developed since its first sighting in the 1960s.  We will consider different theoretical explanations for processes of change and ask questions about who wins and loses.  After acquiring theoretical and conceptual skills we will apply these to a series of international case studies to understand what gentrification might look like and feel like in different places.  What changes?  How do you measure change?  What happens to the people displaced- where do they go to?  Who are the newcomers?  This course will give you insights which will help you better understand neighbourhood level changes; inspire you to learn more about the interaction of social and spatial changes and to think critically about the future of neighbourhoods with which you are familiar.",,2268.0,4.6,19.0

Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet Infrastructures,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-policy-aviation-internet,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Richard White,"In this course we will examine the aviation and Internet infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered ""lifeline infrastructure"" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA.",5896.0,5941.0,4.7,231.0
Cybersecurity Policy for Water and Electricity Infrastructures,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-policy-water-electricity,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Richard White,"This course will examine the drinking water and electricity infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

Data Literacy – What is it and why does it matter?,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-literacy-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Morten Misfeldt, Joanna Osiejewicz, Christian Igel, Floriana Gargiulo, Rasmus Helles, Irina Shklovski, Martin Loebl, Robin Engelhardt, Sergio Splendore","You might already know that data is not neutral. Our values and assumptions are influenced by the data surrounding us - the data we create, the data we collect, and the data we share with each other. Economic needs, social structures, or algorithmic biases can have profound consequences for the way we collect and use data. Most often, the result is an increase of inequity in the world. Data also changes the way we interact. It shapes our thoughts, our feelings, our preferences and actions. It determines what we have access to, and what not. It enables global dissemination of best practices and life improving technologies, as well as the spread of mistrust and radicalization. This is why data literacy matters. 

A key principle of data literacy is to have a heightened awareness of the risks and opportunities of data-driven technologies and to stay up-to-date with their consequences. In this course, we view data literacy from three perspectives: Data in personal life, data in society, and data in knowledge production.  The aim is threefold: 1. To expand your skills and abilities to identify, understand, and interpret the many roles of digital technologies in daily life. 2. To enable you to discern when data-driven technologies add value to people’s lives, and when they exploit human vulnerabilities or deplete the commons.  3. To cultivate a deeper understanding of how data-driven technologies are shaping knowledge production and how they may be realigned with real human needs and values. 

The course is funded by Erasmus+ and developed by the 4EU+ University Alliance including  Charles University (Univerzita Karlova), Sorbonne Unviersity (Sorbonne Université), University of Copenhagen (Københavns Universitet), University of Milan (Università degli studi di Milano), and University of Warsaw (Uniwersytet Warszawski).",,5996.0,4.8,12.0
Data and Urban Governance,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-urban-governance,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Antoine Courmont, Jean-Baptiste Chambon","Since the beginning of the 2000s, cities have witnessed a massive influx of data, transforming how cities are governed. Data has an impact on how city life is structured, as it influences coalitions, actors, instruments, policies, and forms of regulation.

In this MOOC, we will look at this shift more closely: what has the advent of big data done to urban governance? Have platforms disrupted local authorities? How has big data changed local politics? How do we govern using algorithms? What is the place of citizens in the digital city? Is it still possible to be anonymous in the city?

At the end of this course, you will be able to navigate the landscape of urban governance in the digital era, including its myriad actors and instruments; to decipher what drives ongoing transformations in how local governments are structured and operate; to analyze the contemporary changes in municipal service markets; and to understand what is at stake in terms of the creation and implementation of public policies when data comes to town.

Son la plasmación más concreta de la política. Lo que los gobiernos hacen, y dejan de hacer, para hacer frente a los problemas colectivos. Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.

A lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.

 Los objetivos de este curso son:
1.	Mostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.
2.	Transmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.
3.	Contribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.


Por ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas. También se dirige a estudiantes que se dispongan a iniciar estudios de grado o postgrado en administración pública, gestión pública o análisis de políticas públicas.",65371.0,36811.0,4.8,1284.0

In this course, we explore the support that teachers need in order to meet the needs of children with severe to profound hearing, visual and intellectual disabilities.  We consider how this can be done by talking with a range of experts (from teachers to activists) about inclusive education as well as sharing experiences of education. 

Inclusive education is only possible if teachers are supported and empowered to make the curriculum accessible to all learners. The topics in this course cover developing disability confidence and what exactly children with specific impairments need to be able to learn. This includes sharing specific classroom strategies and teaching activities for learners who are D/deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision or have a severe to profound intellectual disability. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the impairment specific needs of learners with disabilities, and how to build systems of support for inclusive education.

Qui gouverne dans une ville investie par le big data ? Les plateformes sont-elles ingouvernables ? Comment gouverne-t-on avec des algorithmes ? Quelle place revient aux citoyens dans cette ville numérique ? Peut-on encore être anonyme en ville ? 

Ce cours vous permettra de vous repérer parmi l’archipel d’acteurs et d’outils qui font le gouvernement urbain à l’ère du numérique et des données ; de décrypter les ressorts des transformations à l’oeuvre dans l’organisation et les pratiques des administrations territoriales; d’analyser les évolutions contemporaines des marchés de service urbain ; et de comprendre les enjeux qui affectent la fabrique et la mise en oeuvre des politiques urbaines lorsque la donnée arrive en ville.

Ce MOOC est proposé par la chaire Villes et numérique de l'Ecole urbaine de SciencesPo, soutenue par La Poste, RTE et la Caisse des Dépôts.

"Doping : Sports, Organizations and Sciences",https://www.coursera.org/learn/doping,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Fabien Ohl,"The objective of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping. To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.

Doping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.
This course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. 
In efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.

Besides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).

Main Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course the participants will be able to :

1.	Identify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,
2.	Go from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,
3.	Recognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,
4.	Explain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,
5.	Identify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.",8772.0,3876.0,4.6,316.0

EU policy and implementation: making Europe work!,https://www.coursera.org/learn/eu-making-europe-work,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Bernard Steunenberg,"People have become more critical of EU policy and often seem to prefer local policy solutions in response to globalisation problems. How do you experience EU policy? Does it help? And if not, how can we change this? In this course, we learn how the European Union prepares and decides on policy, and how policy is transferred to member states and implemented by various authorities, including regional and local governments.  We discuss the challenges of the European multi-level governance structure. We also focus on the main causes of policy failure or success.  On this journey, we focus on actual policy and present the views of various experts: how easy is it to establish yourself in another EU-country? How do governments make sure that the air you breathe is clean? And who is responsible?

You will be able to do research together in your own local setting. Research on implementation in which you can make comparisons between different countries or areas. If you live outside the EU, this is not a problem. We have developed assignments in such a way that you can do research in your area and compare your findings with others.

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
• Researchers from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris
• Field experts from the Agence Française de Développement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,
• Carbone 4 founder Alain Grandjean, who will share his experience, in particular on the economic and financial aspects.
 
Here is the program: 
1.       Our development model is ecologically unsustainable
2.       The dominant economic models hinder the energy and ecological transition
3.       The energy transition path: decarbonizing GDP
4.       The model of an ecological transition to new prosperity
5.       Governance of the energy and ecological transition

Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I - The Role of the State,https://www.coursera.org/learn/economic-growth-part-1,Social Sciences,Law,Professor Yoram  Y. Margalioth,"If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.

""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State"" is the first part of a two part course and it includes the following four lectures: 
(1) What do we need a state for? 
(2) The Relationship between Efficiency and Distributive Justice 
(3) Demonstrating the implications of different ethical theories  
(4) Distributive Justice: measurement and implications
Once you've completed the first part, we strongly recommend that you register for the second part entitled: ""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - Maximizing Social Well-being"", as well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.

The course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.

The course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:
• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;
• Technology as the engine of economic growth;
• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?

The curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.

After successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:
• Better understand economic issues presented in the media
• Form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies
• Define and measure inequality and poverty
• Define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth
• Explain the foundations of economic growth
• Design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals

All these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.

Economics and Policies of Climate Change,https://www.coursera.org/learn/economics-and-policies-of-climate-change,Social Sciences,Economics,"LIONEL MARTELLINI -EDHEC BUSINESS SCHOOL, RICCARDO REBONATO - EDHEC BUSINESS SCHOOL","Being aware of the urgency and importance of climate change is not enough to tackle it effectively. To avoid the worst climate outcomes, decisive action has to be taken. But what realistic options do we have? Since our resources are limited, is it better to act now or wait until we have more advanced and less expensive technology? How big do our abatement efforts have to be?  

This MOOC will help you understand how economists try to answer these questions and find the optimal course of action. Most important, it will give you the conceptual tools to draw your own conclusions.

In the first part of the MOOC, you will learn about the two main approaches used by economists to determine when and how much we should invest in the fight against climate change. The first method is the net-present-value approach. Here the social discount rate plays a central role in determining optimal policy, by showing how future benefits and costs can be compared and made comparable (‘present-valued’) with expenditures today. In the  second approach you will learn how Integrated Assessment  Models (IAMs) work. In particular, you will study in detail the strengths and weaknesses of one of the most popular IAMs, the DICE model, developed by Nobel laureate Professor Nordhaus. This model tries to figure out the optimal course of action by providing a simplified account of the science, the technology and the economics of the problem.

The second part of this MOOC then explores the different types of economic policies that decision-makers can adopt. You will be introduced to different methods used to control emissions, such as carbon taxes, regulations and standard-setting. You will also learn about the most developed emissions trading markets around the world and their effects on the economy.

This MOOC is for those who wish to understand the economics of climate change and use this understanding to form their own informed opinion about the policies on which we can rely to tackle it. It is not necessary to have specialized prior knowledge, apart from basic familiarity with economic concepts such as utility functions. We do suggest, however, taking the first MOOC of this specialization before starting this one in order to gain a simple but solid understanding of the physical and technological aspects of the problems.",2017.0,9445.0,4.5,31.0
Economics of Money and Banking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking,Social Sciences,Economics,Perry G Mehrling,"The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.

Three features of the new system are central.

Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  

Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. 

Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.",139964.0,117244.0,4.9,1410.0

Le cours vous apportera des connaissances économiques vous permettant de comprendre de nombreux mécanismes de nos économies marchandes, comme la concurrence, la formation des prix, les équilibres et déséquilibres. Il fournit aussi des connaissances de base en analyse financière. Il est surtout utile pour qui veut se lancer dans l'investissement immobilier, le montage d'opérations immobilières, l'analyse de faisabilité économique de projets de construction, etc. Il peut même vous aider à préparer l'achat d'une maison ou d'un appartement pour votre propre usage!

Le cours ""Economie du sol et de l'immobilier"" en deux parties vous permettra de comprendre
(1) les calculs des acteurs des marchés foncier et immobilier (propriétaires fonciers, investisseurs immobiliers, etc.)
(2) comment se forment les prix sur ces marchés, en lien avec le marché du logement et les politiques publiques
La première partie introduit les principales méthodes de calcul des valeurs foncières et immobilières. Le cours est illustré d'exemples et de statistiques principalement suisses.

Dans ce premier cours (Economie du sol et de l'immobilier I), nous aborderons:
•	Les calculs d'arbitrage et les déterminants et composantes du taux de rendement
•	La détermination du consentement à payer des acheteurs
•	La concurrence entre acheteurs
•	Le point de vue du propriétaire foncier
•	Les méthodes de calcul des valeurs immobilières

Il est vivement recommandé d'effectuer les deux parties du cours dans l'ordre, puisque la deuxième utilise les concepts développés dans la première. Les deux parties sont de difficulté comparable.

Chaque partie est structurée en modules hebdomadaires. Chaque module compte 5 ou 6 vidéos expliquant un thème. Chaque vidéo est suivie d'un quiz permettant de vérifier les concepts de la vidéo. Ces quiz demandent des calculs algébriques et numériques qui peuvent facilement être réalisés avec une calculatrice, mieux encore avec un tableur. Un formulaire est proposé en entrée du cours pour rappeler les opérations mathématiques utilisées dans le cours. Il s'agit principalement de manipuler des équations pour en extraire le terme recherché. A la fin de chaque module, il y a un quiz d'évaluation, qui doit être réussi avant de passer au module suivant.

Este contexto nos demanda problematizar la realidad socio ambiental, repensar formas para reconectarnos con la naturaleza y crear conciencia de la interdependencia y la corresponsabilidad a través de la educación ambiental. 

Este curso tiene como propósito brindar perspectivas, conocimientos y estrategias en torno a la educación ambiental desde una mirada integral, haciendo foco en la biodiversidad. En un tiempo en el que la trama de la vida se encuentra amenazada, reconocemos la importancia de atender a las metas de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ONU, 2015) y proponemos pensar la educación ambiental para la biodiversidad como herramienta de cambio biocultural promoviendo la conservación, la restauración, el uso sustentable y la regeneración de la naturaleza. 

A su vez, este curso ofrece distintos lineamientos y estrategias pedagógicas para llevar adelante acciones ambientales participativas en diferentes ámbitos y contextos; tejiendo redes, activando alianzas y teniendo como premisa la participación social y la ciudadanía ambiental.

Educating Deaf Children: Becoming an Empowered Teacher,https://www.coursera.org/learn/educating-deaf-children,Social Sciences,Education,"Odette Swift, Tara Kuhn","Many Deaf children around the world still leave school functionally illiterate. In some cases there is no allowance made for education of Deaf children at all. This 4 week course provides you with invaluable knowledge and skills about teaching Deaf children. You will learn about the importance of Deaf culture and community, the need for a language rich environment for the Deaf child from as young as possible, and that having access to sign language can help Deaf children academically, emotionally, and socially. We also cover various accommodations and modifications that you can apply in your classroom and learning environment to create an accessible learning experience for Deaf children. You will also find that a shift in attitude will enable you to connect with Deaf children with more understanding.

Effective Engagement of Civil Society in Development,https://www.coursera.org/learn/effective-engagement-of-civil-society-in-development,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Sanne Huesken,"Civil society organizations (CSOs) are key actors in development that have valuable contributions to make. They play a multitude of roles - including in relation to humanitarian assistance, service-delivery, research and policy development, and pursuing accountability from governments and other stakeholders – all of which can significantly contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CSOs are expected to play a critical role in implementing the SDGs and in monitoring their progress. It is therefore urgent that CSOs meaningfully and effectively engage in development processes. But what is needed for CSOs to be able to do so? This Online Interactive Guidance offers some answers to that question. It takes participants through a history of the international commitments that call for this multi-stakeholder collaboration; what this means in practice for different development actors; and the benefits that can ensue through means of good practice examples from countries across the globe.

Learning objectives
Following the completion of the 5 modules of the Online Interactive Guidance, participants will be able to:
•	Describe the rationale behind the need to engage civil society in development processes;
•	Define the CSO enabling environment and CSO development effectiveness as key components to ensuring 
         effective engagement of CSOs in development;
•	Recall the international commitments on the CSO enabling environment and CSO development 
         effectiveness;
•	Distinguish the roles and responsibilities of different development actors in ensuring effective engagement 
        of CSOs in development;
•	Identify practical ways in which governments, donors and civil society can engage to create a CSO enabling 
        environment and ensure CSO development effectiveness;
•	Identify good practices for a CSO enabling environment and development effectiveness;
•	Indicate the benefits that can ensue from implementing good practices;
•	Translate the international commitments and apply these to their own context.

Methodology
This Online Interactive Guidance consists of five modules developed around the overall learning objectives. Each module starts with an animated video introducing the topic and is followed by good practice examples; insights from the field in the form of video interviews; in-depth readings; and an online activity. 

Set-up
The Online Guidance will lead participants through the modules that each play a part in creating an environment in which CSOs can meaningfully and effectively contribute to implementation and monitoring of international development processes. 
> Module 1 will examine the CSO-related commitments that the international community has subscribed to and will provide an introduction to the four ways in which these can be realized. 
> Module 2 will explore the means towards creating effective multi-stakeholder dialogue, which is key to creating a CSO enabling environment. 
> Module 3 will examine CSOs’ own responsibility in ensuring their effectiveness, accountability and transparency in their day-to-day operations.
> Module 4 will delve into how providers of official development cooperation can effectively work with and for CSOs. 
> Module 5 is the concluding module and will examine how a country’s rules and regulations can determine an enabling environment for CSOs to operate in. 

Completion
Participants who have completed the 5 modules can request a certificate extended by the Task Team on CSO Development Effectiveness & Enabling Environment.",,1620.0,4.8,27.0

Which rights and opportunities does this supra- and transnational citizenship provide? And what are the challenges and dilemmas of the two-level citizenship – for individuals, for the member states and for the union? This course examines the development, the scope and the challenges of European Citizenship.

The course has a threefold aim: to explore the development, application and current challenges of European citizenship. This aim is examined through three modules. The first module focuses on the development of European Citizenship: What are the substantive rights of citizenship beyond the state, and which institutions have been key to their development? Here, we focus on free movement for persons, cross-border welfare, and political rights – especially the European Citizens' Initiative. The second module focuses on the application of EU citizenship: How is EU citizenship practised? Is EU citizenship limited or extensive when compared to the US federal system, for example? Is it still foremost a right for those who move from member state to member state, but not for those who stay in their member state of origin? Finally, the third module examines the extent to which the rules and rights around European citizenship have been contested and politicized during the last decade. In this part of the course, we also look into the de-Europeanisation of citizenship through Brexit.

Facilitate Organized Online Dialogue with Considerit,https://www.coursera.org/learn/online-dialogue-considerit,Social Sciences,Education,Danilo Oliveira Vaz,"Why is it so hard to participate in fruitful online dialogues, especially with dozens or hundreds of participants? Why do we so easily get caught up on divisive topics and opinions, instead of building up on each other perspectives? One may argue that the tools often used for such discussions (i.e., social media) are, by design, biased toward polarizing discourse. 

Therefore, this project presents Considerit, a digital tool for ""civil, organized, and efficient online dialogue"". While participating in and creating a forum on Considerit you will experience its capacity to handle nuances of complex discussions, as well as for visually summarizing what a community thinks about a specific statement, and why.

Federalism & Decentralization: Evaluating Africa's Track Record,https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralization-africa,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Dr. Jan Erk,"In this political science course you will learn about the twin concepts of federalism and decentralization. You will develop an understanding of the core ideas that federalism and decentralization rest on, and study the building blocks that make them both work. Following a general overview of both federalism and decentralization, we will examine a number of case-studies from Africa where federalism and decentralization have been changing the continent’s political landscape in the last twenty years, coinciding with unprecedented levels of economic growth. 

What is federalism and how is it different from decentralization? What are the core ideas behind these concepts? Do federalism and decentralization enhance democracy, governance and diversity? Is that why virtually all countries south of the Sahara are now either federal or decentralized? We will be looking at Africa's track-record in order to answer these questions.

By the end of the course, you will have acquired a general knowledge of federalism/decentralization and additional empirical knowledge of a number of African cases.  Upon completion you will also acquire the ability to unpack and understand a variety of potential consequences of federalism/decentralization reforms in the developing world.",7778.0,4961.0,4.7,129.0
Financing Infrastructure in African Cities,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financing-infrastructure-in-african-cities,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Somesh Sharma, Jaap Spronk, Meine Pieter van Dijk, Bernadette Ssanyu","The world is urbanizing fast. In less than a century more than 1 billion people have been urbanized. That translates into the fact that more than half of the world’s population is already living in cities. Experts forecast that very soon Africa will become one of the most urbanized continents. However, almost 70% of world’s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water. 

The reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life. Local governments struggle with mobilizing finances so that they can improve your quality of life but many times they are not aware of the right mechanisms. 

Imagine that your government wants to know how can they finance cities and they want you to advise – where will you begin with? Our finance experts are bringing their experience right at your Desk through this MOOC. This MOOC has five modules and in five weeks you will learn:
•	Financial decision making environment in urban systems
•	Mechanisms for mobilizing local revenues
•	Innovative mechanisms for financing infrastructure projects through partnerships, and 
•	Financial decision making under uncertainties and risks

We will provide you a carefully selected set of literature, quizzes and interactive discussion forums. So join our MOOC and find out the ways to make your city a better place to live in for yourself and for your next generations.

Este curso desarrolla y fortalece sus capacidades para formar, en la escuela, a ciudadanos que actúen de manera constructiva en una sociedad democrática, particularmente en tres ámbitos de la ciudadanía: la convivencia pacífica, la participación democrática y la valoración de las diferencias.

Si está interesado en aportar a la construcción de una sociedad pacífica, democrática e incluyente a través de la educación, este es el lugar donde puede aprender herramientas pedagógicas primordiales para cumplir esa misión. Si bien el curso presenta ideas que pueden ser útiles para actores educativos en general, los ejemplos y estrategias están particularmente dirigidos a docentes de contextos escolares.

Teniendo en cuenta que formar para el ejercicio activo, crítico y constructivo de la ciudadanía es una necesidad prioritaria en los contextos actuales, el curso presenta los temas, asuntos, problemas y conceptos indispensables para promover el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanas de niños, niñas y jóvenes en formación. Para lograrlo se propone analizar la ciudadanía a través de la ampliación progresiva de sus contextos de aplicación: el individual, el interpersonal, el grupal, el comunitario y el mundial.

Adicionalmente a estas comprensiones conceptuales, el curso ofrece la oportunidad de desarrollar capacidades didácticas en los participantes, quienes podrán diseñar estrategias pedagógicas orientadas al desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas de sus educandos y a la construcción de ambientes democráticos de aprendizaje que favorezcan dicho desarrollo.

Las actividades propuestas en el curso están diseñadas de tal forma que los participantes puedan apropiarse de herramientas conceptuales y pedagógicas a partir del principio de “aprender haciendo”, en donde permanentemente estarán poniendo en práctica dichos aprendizajes. Este es un curso ampliamente flexible que permite a los participantes escoger diferentes rutas de aprendizaje para concentrarse en los contenidos de su interés y/o en el nivel de profundización que quieren alcanzar para cada uno de ellos. Es así como el curso permitirá, especialmente a docentes escolares, desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades que les permitan educar para la ciudadanía, formando ciudadanos activos y críticos, que respeten la diferencia, que conozcan y hagan uso de los mecanismos de participación para la transformación de sus comunidades y que resuelvan pacífica y constructivamente los conflictos y retos que les plantea la sociedad en su rol como ciudadanos de su vida, de su comunidad y del mundo.

From Climate Science to Action,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-science,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Alan S. Miller , Claudia Barrera","Each part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the 21st century. With the ratification of the Paris Agreement, many countries have acceded to act in combatting climate change. Indeed, without climate action, decades of sustainable development is at risk, thus making this a ‘make or break’ point in time. Showcasing the most recent scientific evidence, explaining the different regional impacts and divulging climate action strategies, along with interactive tools such as a Carbon Footprint Tracker and (I) NDC Platform, this MOOC provides some opportunities, where you can take action on climate change.

About the Course

This action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:

•  Latin America and Caribbean
•  Sub-Saharan Africa
•  Middle East and North Africa
•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia
•  East Asia and Pacific
•  South Asia

 In this endeavor, the MOOC brings together renowned scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development strategies across sectors. A team of expert Instructors will lead discussions around the Paris Agreement, reflections from COP22 and the progress on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Course Syllabus

Overview 

‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!

Week 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century

•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century
•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action
•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity 
•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification

Week 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts

•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions
•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations

Game Theory,https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1,Social Sciences,Economics,"Matthew O. Jackson, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham","Popularized by movies such as ""A Beautiful Mind,"" game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call `games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and a few applications.

Game Theory II: Advanced Applications,https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-2,Social Sciences,Economics,"Matthew O. Jackson, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham","Popularized by movies such as ""A Beautiful Mind"", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.

In the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no ""perfect"" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain ""mechanism design"" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.

We are delighted to have you with us, and hope that the next six weeks will provide an interesting and thoughtful experience for you. 

We hope the course will give you an overview of global health and humanitarianism in theory and in practice. These fields overlap, and are connected, in many significant ways. However, we have used three key themes to explore our subjects: each key theme will be discussed over two week blocks by specialist course lecturers, and supported by unique video perspectives by three keynote speakers who are leading specialists in the field. 

 - Weeks 1 & 2: An Introduction to Global Health Dr Amy Hughes MBE;
 - Weeks 3 & 4: Humanitarian Responses and Dilemmas Dr Tim Jacoby; 
 - Weeks 5 & 6: The Right to Humanitarian Assistance and the Responsibility to Protect Dr Kirsten Howarth.

To get the best out of the course we encourage you to try and set aside a few hours each week. This will give you time to work through videos, written materials and linked resources, and to get involved with discussion with other learners. We have provided a variety of different readings, resources and suggested activity based on the course content. Some will be essential to your understanding of the MOOC themes, and to assessment (if you have chosen to take part in assessment activity). Others will be for those of you who want to discover more about a particular subject or perspective, or to make your own study of global health or humanitarianism in action. Check through the weekly resources and content to find out which best suit your needs.

During the course we will look at a range of different opinions and debates, linked to key themes and addressing ethics and moral issues. We hope you will be inspired and encouraged to explore and share your own perspectives, and those of others, throughout the course. Different viewpoints are essential to understanding global health and humanitarian practice.

How can we understand the process as a whole? How are the parts of the world linked? What are the risks of living in a world where “no one is in charge”? This course introduces students to systems thinking, network theory, and risk analysis and uses these tools to better understand the process of globalization. Focusing on trade, finance, and epidemiology, it analyzes potential challenges to the current global order.

The course will be of interest to those studying global affairs, system dynamics, and world governance. It offers a set of heuristics that students can use to analyze contemporary global challenges. Linking the recording of Abbey Road to the COVID-19 pandemic provides new insights into the apparently chaotic world around us.

Complex systems form the backbone of our increasingly interconnected and interdependent society. What were once more localized economies, supply chains, and social-ecological systems are now rapidly globalizing, and interacting with one another across countless spatial and temporal scales as technologies expand at ever greater velocities. These tightly coupled systems deliver greater efficiency and prosperity, but at the cost of greater fragility and the threat of catastrophic failure. This “global systemic risk” has implications in all functional domains affecting our daily lives—from the global financial system to healthcare, to critical infrastructure networks.

The public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a context of pervasive uncertainty, heightened anxiety, and social isolation that overlaps with a critical time of your own learning and development. The COVID-19 pandemic also has exacerbated long-standing inequalities and disparities, and recent events in the United States have laid bare historical and current realities of racism and systemic oppression. These challenges make starting college complicated in unprecedented ways, compounded by the fact that our university settings are themselves complex and rapidly changing. These challenges also present unique opportunities for interdisciplinary and practical learning. 

This course aims to help you navigate this world and the new conditions for learning with knowledge and skill. We designed the course with participatory methods, which means that we asked students to take a key role as partners with faculty in designing the course content, structure, and learning experiences. Together, we sought to integrate faculty expertise with the perspectives and experiences of students to make the course material relevant to your life. 

In this class, we will explore perspectives on disease and society and on systemic racism and inequality with scholars in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, education, communications and media, and engineering. Engaging these disciplines to examine the complex problems of the global pandemic and systemic racism will help you build conceptual and practical skills that you will use throughout college and beyond.  

In conjunction with investigating health and social crises, new and ongoing, we also will explore the science and practice of individual and community wellness. You will learn skills relevant to emotions, relationships, common mental health concerns, and learning in the age of Zoom and remote classes. You will learn practices of cooperation, compassion, and anti-racism for community wellness.

Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists,https://www.coursera.org/learn/homeland-security-cybersecurity-connection,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Richard White,"Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950, Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its connection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

Hot Topics in Criminal Justice,https://www.coursera.org/learn/hot-topics-criminal-justice,Social Sciences,Law,Christopher Slobogin,"The American criminal justice system is in need of reform. We incarcerate too many people. We pay insufficient attention to scientific advances that can help separate out the most and least culpable and dangerous. We grant the police far too much power to use force and technological surveillance. 

As a way of thinking about dealing with these problems, this course examines two over-arching issues: What should we do with people who have committed crime, and how should we identify who they are? On the first issue, we will look closely at the nature and causes of mass incarceration, the death penalty, the lawfulness and usefulness of preventive detention and risk assessment, and the role of the insanity defense and neuroscience in assessing responsibility for crime. On the second issue, we will explore the laws regulating the police use of force, the growing role of technology and big data in facilitating police surveillance and detection and deterrence of crime, and the remedies for police malfeasance, including the exclusionary rule and damages actions. 

The overall goal is to help thinking individuals assess today’s criminal justice system and consider ways of making it better. After completing this course, participants should be able to: 

1. Describe the mass incarceration problem in the United States and why it might exist; 
2. Suggest ways of reducing incarceration; 
3. Criticize risk assessment instruments and their use in preventive detention schemes;

In this course, Prof. Robert Heinsch, Dr. Giulia Pinzauti and Dr. Emma Irving will give you a deep insight into the rules that govern armed conflict, and aim to mitigate human suffering on the battlefield. You will explore the why and how of IHL, followed by the different types of conflict. In no time you will find out which rules apply to the civil war in Syria, the military intervention in Ukraine and the occupation of the West Bank. During this course, you will learn how hostilities should be waged: Which weapons can be used by combatants and other fighters? And, who should never be a target during military operations? We will also look into the concept of protected persons, and you will find out how IHL affords protection to the sick and wounded, medical personal, detainees, children, journalists and other persons who are not - or not anymore - fighting. At the end of this course, you are introduced to the different implementation and enforcement mechanisms that aim to increase respect for IHL. Here, you are invited to think critically whether IHL works!

The first course covered international courts and tribunals in The Hague in general. This second course provides an insider perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  You will learn about the investigation and prosecution of international crimes in The Hague. 

Atrocities produce unspeakable forms of violence. We will explore whether and how international criminal justice contribute to what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon called the ‘age of accountability’. The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable, whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.

During this course, you will be offered a look into the ‘kitchen’ of the Hague international criminal courts and tribunals. You will learn how international criminal justice functions, who the actors are, what outcomes it produces, and how it can be improved. 

If you want to gain a better understanding of international criminal cases, like the Lubanga case, the ICC’s first ever trial, and the legal legacy of UN international criminal tribunals, then this course is definitely for you!

The first module of the course will investigate how judicial settlement is different from other more political forms of dispute settlement, such as negotiation and mediation. It offers a brief historical overview and introduces the judicial and arbitral bodies based in The Hague. In the remaining modules you will learn about the functions of these courts and tribunals, and some of the challenges and prospects that they face. Three cross-cutting themes tie together all of these modules: (i) The interaction between law and politics; (ii) The continuing role of State consent; and (iii) The ability of international courts and tribunals to protect the public interest and global values.

This course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into the functions and features of the courts and tribunals present in The Hague. You will gain a familiarity with each court or tribunal. You will develop realistic expectations of their capacity to address contemporary problems and an awareness of their limitations.

The first course covered generalities on the international courts and tribunals in The Hague, while the second course provided an insider's  perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  This third course explores the major aspects of international arbitration as one of the most common method of international dispute settlement . Through this course you will gain an in-depth understanding of the  various facets of international arbitration through the analysis of its role as a mechanism of dispute settlement, its institutions, the fields of law it is applicable to, and, of course, its most famous awards. 

The main question we will answer together during this course is ""Can international arbitration contribute to the creation of a peaceful world through the settlement of disputes between States and between States and non-State actors?"" In order to do so, we will learn the basic historical concepts or arbitration, as well as everything there is to know about the Permanent Court of Arbitration, based in The Hague. We will then dive into the role of international arbitration in settling disputes relating to the Law of the Sea, with a particular insight into the landmark South China Sea Arbitration. For an entire module, we will focus on investment arbitration, its principles and the procedure of the ICSID, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. We will conclude the course with a module on the interplay between state immunity and enforcement of arbitral awards. This is brought to light through the Yukos Arbitration which is a perfect illustration of the topic.

This course offers you an opportunity to gain a better insight into international arbitration, its role and the current issues relating to it. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the principles and rules of arbitration. You will explore the topic through concrete examples and the most prominent arbitrations. You will also grasp the notion of international arbitration navigating between law and politics. International arbitration and The Hague go hand in hand: several key arbitration institutes are located in The Hague and important disputes were settled here through arbitration. The Hague is, so to speak, ‘the place to be for international arbitration’, especially when we are dealing with arbitration between States, or arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and States.

International Water Law,https://www.coursera.org/learn/international-water-law,Social Sciences,Law,"Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Makane Moïse Mbengue, Mara Tignino, Komlan Sangbana","In recent decades, international law has undergone a series of major developments in order to accommodate the many new facets of freshwater management and protection. The adoption of universal, regional and basin instruments highlights how important it is to study the evolution of international water regulations and to be able to identify the main principles in this field. This course aims to provide the necessary background to understand and examine the regulation applicable to transboundary freshwaters especially to rivers, lakes and aquifers. It presents the principles and legal standards that govern the use, sharing, management and protection of these resources. 

The MOOC is made up of 5 modules. As each module addresses a different theme, they can be viewed in any order. However, the modules do follow a certain pedagogical logic and following in order will be especially helpful to those who are new to the subject. Each module is accompanied by an evaluation questionnaire or quiz. A certificate will be awarded to students who obtain an average of at least 80% in the quizzes. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to: 
1) Describe the issues related to the regulation of transboundary freshwaters; 
2) Explain how transboundary freshwater regulations have evolved; 
3) Recall and interpret the key principles governing water resource regulation; 
4) Understand the role of transboundary freshwater dispute settlement mechanisms in the development of international freshwater law (or to understand the role of international courts and tribunals in the resolution of conflicts)  

This MOOC was developed by the Platform for International Freshwater Law that is part of the Geneva Water Hub, assisted by the MOOC Team of the University of Geneva. Alongside the researchers and teachers of the Platform, several international experts have also participated. This MOOC is one of three courses supported by the Water Hub Geneva and the University of Geneva. The other MOOCS are ""Water Management and Policy"" (www.coursera.org/learn/gestioneau) and ""Ecosystem Services: a method for sustainable development ""(www.coursera.org/learn/ecosystem-services). The Global Water Program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has funded this course.

Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms,https://www.coursera.org/learn/internetgiants,Social Sciences,Law,Randal C. Picker,"This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.

The course will explore seven topics:

 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.

 2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.

 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.

 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.

 5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.

 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.

 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.",54986.0,20137.0,4.8,1029.0

Introduction aux Droits de l’Homme,https://www.coursera.org/learn/droits-de-lhomme,Social Sciences,Law,"Maya Hertig Randall, Michel Hottelier","Ce cours propose une introduction à la protection internationale des droits de l’homme. Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect. 

Depuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.

Le présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?

En abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.

Le cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.

Le cours est donné en français. Il consiste en une série de 8 sessions, comprenant chacune un certain nombre de brèves présentations vidéo (8 à 15 minutes). Chaque session s'accompagne d'un questionnaire d'évaluation. Des lectures préparatoires sont requises pour chaque session.",61734.0,27576.0,4.9,1563.0

Introduction to Communication Science,https://www.coursera.org/learn/communication,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Rutger de  Graaf,"Since Antiquity, scholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we cannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.

Introduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through communication. 

Upon completion of this course, students should:
•	have knowledge of the history and development of communication science; 
•	have knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; 
•	have knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field.

Introduction to Economic Theories,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-economic-theories,Social Sciences,Economics,"Irene van Staveren, Rob van Tulder, Maria Dafnomili","Wondering why economists have not predicted serious financial crises? Shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self-centered and focusing only on what can be measured? Asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets? Then you are at the right place to learn economics! 

This is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective. Economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world. This MOOC will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form. You will see not only me, a Professor of Economics, but also a pop-up Prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society. And you will meet an online student, based in Greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which I will explain key concepts, tools and techniques. 

I will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does. Instead, I will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. The theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical. The four theories that I like to introduce you to are Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Post Keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, Neoclassical Economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets. But not everything is different in this course. Like every economics course, it includes numbers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations. 

Why would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one? Because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought. It will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self-centered and focusing on the measurable only. Other economic theories go well beyond these limitations. And, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets. 

The objective of this course is twofold. First, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives. Second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets.

Please note that if you do all course elements, total course load is likely to be 4 ECT  (approx. 134 hours).

I hope you will enjoy the course!",60147.0,59156.0,4.5,295.0

Introduction to the Orbital Perspective,https://www.coursera.org/learn/orbitalperspective,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Ron Garan,"The goals of this course are to develop the student’s critical thinking skills, global awareness, and ability to work as an integral part of a team in an increasingly complex global job market. The course provides a foundation in such skills as team building, collaboration, and elevated empathy using real-world scenarios from some of world’s most effective collaborative projects including the Earthrise-2068 Project.  

Living on the International Space Station was a powerful, transformative experience—one that could hold the key to solving our problems here on Earth. On space walks and through windows, course instructor Ron Garan was struck by the stunning beauty of the Earth from space but sobered by knowing how much needed to be done to help this troubled planet. And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were “the enemy.” If fifteen nations could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. 

In this course Garan will convey what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, the course will address how we can apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This course is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth.

Israel State and Society,https://www.coursera.org/learn/israel,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Michal Frenkel,"Israel is a country that draws a lot of public attention around the globe. Nevertheless, both those who support Israel and those who are critical of its geopolitical standing and policies, usually have a very limited knowledge about the Israeli society and its political system. This course presents Israel from multiple perspectives - political, social, economic and cultural - in an attempt to expose the learners to a cutting edge academic research on the country. 

Each of the 13 sessions is focused on one aspect of the Israeli society. Every session starts with a general introduction of the issue at hand, hosting one expert or more, who share their most recent studies and insights on that specific field. Every 15 minutes, or so, the students are asked to answer an informative quiz of comprised of a single question. Upon the completion of each class, an online chat will be opened. Students studying for credit are expected to participate in it, ask relevant questions and answer questions about the required readings for this class. 

Students will graduate from this course with a better understanding of the Israeli society, better knowledge of the Israeli history, politics and economy, and better acquaintance with the varying groups of which the Israeli society is comprised.",11193.0,9759.0,4.7,324.0

Jewish Diaspora in Modern China,https://www.coursera.org/learn/jews-in-china,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Xin Xu,"Jewish Diaspora in China is a unique experience for world Jewry, as China is the only country in Far East that has had Jews living in its society for over 1,000 years. Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more.",10181.0,,4.3,105.0
Journalism Skills for Engaged Citizens,https://www.coursera.org/learn/journalism-skills,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Dr.  Denis Muller, Dr. Margaret Simons","This is a course in basic journalism skills, designed for the many people who are now taking advantage of new media to publish news, views and information. For five hundred years, the privilege of being able to publish was enjoyed by very few people – those who had access to a printing press or a radio microphone or a television camera. Now, almost anyone can publish to the world within minutes of being able to do so. But is it journalism?

How does a citizen journalist find things out, so they can report facts and news - moving beyond merely braying opinion? And what are the legal and ethical pitfalls to publishing facts that some people might prefer remain secret?

Over six weeks, this course teaches the basics of news writing, how to interview people to gain crucial information, how to develop and manage your sources and how to use your legal rights to access public information - and stay on the right side of the law when you publish. We discuss the ethics behind journalism practice, and conduct a mock investigation into local government. This course aims to empower engaged citizens to better participate in the news ecology.

What are ways we become educated through different stages of our lives? Each individual takes a unique journey to and through education. Join us in exploring these questions and others, as learning happens in more places than a classroom. 

A Teach-Out is an online public educational event that sparks discussion and action around a topic of societal importance. This Teach-Out contains no quizzes and no certificate of completion, as it is not a course.  You will be presented with videos, discussion questions, resources for further inquiry, and a call-to-action. The purpose of this Teach-Out event is to engage in a dialogue about education by exploring different perspectives, listening to the voices of others, and respectfully sharing your own experiences and thoughts.

Emory would like to give a special thanks to Tara Westover, author of “Educated.” Emory selected Westover’s memoir as the 2019-2020 Common Read. The Common Reading program is an opportunity for all incoming first-year students and first year PhD students to engage in meaningful conversation through a community narrative. Developing a Teach-Out on topics related to Westover’s memoir, opens the conversation beyond Emory’s campus community and invites you to engage with one another no matter where you live.",,,,

La Philanthropie : Comprendre et Agir,https://www.coursera.org/learn/philanthropie,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Arthur Gautier, Anne-Claire Pache","Littéralement « amour de l’humanité », la philanthropie désigne aujourd’hui l'ensemble des dons librement consentis par des acteurs privés en faveur de l'intérêt général. Dans les médias, la philanthropie est incarnée aujourd’hui par les milliardaires américains Bill Gates et Warren Buffet qui ont donné une grande part de leur fortune à une fondation en faveur de la santé et de l’éducation. Mais cette vision est partielle : la philanthropie est très active dans la plupart des régions du monde, pas seulement aux Etats-Unis, et ce ne sont pas seulement les très riches qui donnent, puisque de nombreux particuliers et entreprises s’impliquent. 

En ce début de XXIe siècle marqué par les crises économiques et politiques, la philanthropie joue un rôle croissant pour répondre aux grands défis de notre temps. Alternative au modèle marchand et à la redistribution publique via l’impôt, le don privé est activement recherché pour financer la lutte contre la pauvreté, l’éducation, la recherche médicale ou la culture… Partout dans le monde, les fondations se multiplient, les dons se développent et influencent la vie de très nombreuses personnes. Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive. 

Malgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer? L’objectif de ce MOOC est de répondre à ces quatre grandes questions, en mobilisant les dernières avancées en matière de recherche et le point de vue d’experts reconnus dans leur domaine. 

Que vous soyez simplement curieux de découvrir le sujet, déjà donateur ou engagé dans une démarche philanthropique, ou un professionnel qui accompagne ou sollicite des philanthropes, ce MOOC est fait pour vous ! Chaque semaine, vous progresserez grâce à des vidéos alliant théorie et pratique, des lectures pour aller plus loin, des quiz pour renforcer vos acquis et des forums où vous pourrez échanger entre participants et avec l’équipe pédagogique.

Large Marine Ecosystems: Assessment and Management,https://www.coursera.org/learn/large-marine-ecosystems,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Coleen Moloney,"Focusing on the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the world, this course will introduce the concept and practice of ecosystem-based management. LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km² or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.

Because LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining.) This represents a new type of management approached - shifting from single sector-based to multi-sector assessment and management within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.

Together, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach in 22 projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world’s oceans.

Learning to Teach Online,https://www.coursera.org/learn/teach-online,Social Sciences,Education,"Associate Professor Simon McIntyre, Dr Negin Mirriahi","Are you an educator? Have you ever wanted to understand more about how to design your class to make better use of educational technology – whether fully online or in blended contexts? Would you like to learn from those who have extensive practical experience with online technologies? 

The Learning to Teach Online (LTTO) MOOC will help you develop a working understanding of successful online teaching strategies that you can apply in your own practice. The course is based upon the multi award winning open educational resource developed by Dr Simon McIntyre and Karin Watson. 

Integrating online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths better than you, and the “one size fits all” formula doesn’t always suit everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your educational context. 

This course will guide you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance your course design. You will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of effective online teaching practices and their relationship to the use of different technologies. You will also be encouraged to progressively design and reflect upon your own online learning activity, assessment or resource for use in your own class if you choose to undertake the course assignments.",162842.0,61840.0,4.7,2868.0

The first is theoretical, in which we attempt to develop an overall frame of reference, locating approaches to the psychology of learning in terms of large paradigm shifts, from ‘behaviorism’ to ‘brain developmentalism’ to ‘social cognitivism’. The second component is practical, in which we will use these theoretical concepts to ‘parse’ a technology-mediated learning environment for its underlying presuppositions.

Les Partenariats Public-Privé (PPP): Comment offrir de meilleures infrastructures pour les services publics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/partenariats-public-prive,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"M. Olivier Frémond, Dianne Rudo","Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la mise en place de services d’infrastructures, en particulier dans les économies émergentes. Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services publics par des PPP efficaces.

Le cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures, des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins, L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.

Ce cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP, que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien, un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.

~~ A propos du cours

Partout dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP) sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.

Durant ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.
Plusieurs ressources seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens, des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.

~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP

Ce premier module explique comment et pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures. Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.

~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP

Ce module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.

~~ Semaine 3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP

Ce module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement. Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration de l’appel d’offre.

~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise en œuvre du PPP 

Ce module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat, et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.

~~ Comment bénéficier au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir

Les participants peuvent choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels.

Local Economic Development,https://www.coursera.org/learn/local-economic-development,Social Sciences,Economics,"Peter Knorringa, Bert Helmsing , Jan Fransen, Georgina Gomez, Salomey  Gyamfi Afrifa","Welcome to this MOOC on Local Economic Development (LED). Local economic development refers to the processes by which local governments, businesses, and civil society groups get together to raise income sustainably and improve their lives in a well-defined area. It’s about creating jobs, securing livelihoods, improving infrastructure and managing local resources.

What do I learn?

We will be dealing with questions such as the following. Why does economic development take place in some areas of the world and not in others? Why doesn’t it happen in your place? What prevents people from having the lives they want to live right there? Could your region make more of the opportunities of globalization and new technologies? Did the promises of decentralization in your country fail to deliver better public services and more responsive governments? If these are the questions you are asking yourself, this is the right course for you. It explores the where, who and how of economic development.

Please have a look at our list of contents for the coming 8 weeks:
1.	What is LED? What drives it?
2.	How does globalization shape LED?
3.	How does decentralisation affect LED?
4.	How does competitiveness affect innovation?
5.	What are entrepreneurship and its dimensions?
6.	Why are value chains and clusters so important?
7.	What are some LED strategies?
8.	Your project

How will I learn?

In each week you will be able to access the content of the videos, suggested readings and additional videos for selective deepening. You will also find assignments that you have to complete if you want to earn a certificate for this MOOC. We will first introduce our “toolkit”, a series of theories and concepts that will help you read the situation in your locality. We will explore the main factors affecting local economic development, such as globalization, decentralisation, and competitiveness. We will discuss key components, like entrepreneurship and innovation and look into the organization of local economies into clusters, value chains and learning regions. We will conclude by deepening on some specific constructs that make local economies grow to benefit their communities. You will also contribute your ideas in the discussion forums, where you will learn from other participants around the world. 

What makes this course special? 
There is plenty of information in Internet on local economic development, which is mostly prepared by international donors or multilateral organisations. So what does this course do differently? First of all, the course is offered by academics that have significant published research on local economic development. This course gathers a wealth of academic knowledge that often fights the assumptions on what things are supposed to be like. Second, the instructors of this course have participated in dozens of capacity building projects in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Putting learning at the centre, they worked with communities, local governments, international donors and business associations. They often found a significant distance between theory and practice in local economic development, and this has been the basis of learning. Third, the course is acutely aware that each region is different and does not attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all recipe. It singles out key factors that drive local economic development and enables participants to do their own learning process, defining local problems and appropriate solutions. The aim of the course is that participants come up with their own ideas on how to promote local economic development.

How will I get a certificate?

If you want a certificate for participating in this MOOC, you will need to complete a small assignment each week and participate in the discussion forums. In the end of the MOOC, you will put these contributions together in one final document, your Capstone Project. 

I hope you find this course exciting and that you get to share our passion for promoting local economic development.

L’engagement efficace de la société civile dans le développement,https://www.coursera.org/learn/engagement-efficace-de-la-societe-civile-dans-le-developpement,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Sanne Huesken,"Les organisations de la société civile (OSC) sont des acteurs clés du développement qui ont des contributions précieuses à apporter. Elles jouent une multitude de rôles – notamment en lien avec l’aide humanitaire, la prestation de services, la recherche et l’élaboration de politiques, et avec la responsabilisation des gouvernements et des autres parties prenantes – tous domaines dans lesquels elles peuvent avoir une contribution significative à la réalisation des objectifs de développement durable (ODD). On attend des OSC qu’elles jouent un rôle essentiel dans la mise en œuvre des ODD et dans le suivi de leurs progrès. Il est donc urgent que les OSC s’engagent de manière significative et efficace dans les processus de développement. Mais quelles sont les conditions requises pour que les OSC soient en mesure de le faire ? Ce Guide interactif en ligne propose quelques réponses à cette question. 

Objectifs d’apprentissage
Après avoir terminé les 5 modules du Guide interactif en ligne, les participants seront en mesure de :
•	Décrire la raison d’être de l’engagement de la société civile dans les processus de développement ;
•	Définir l’environnement propice aux OSC et l’efficacité des OSC en matière de développement en tant 
        qu’éléments clés pour assurer un engagement efficace des OSC dans le développement ;
•	Rappeler les engagements internationaux relatifs à l’environnement propice aux OSC et à l’efficacité des OSC 
        en matière de développement ;
•	Distinguer les rôles et responsabilités des différents acteurs du développement pour assurer un 
        engagement efficace des OSC dans le développement ;
•	Identifier les moyens pratiques par lesquels les gouvernements, les donateurs et la société civile peuvent 
        s’engager pour créer un environnement propice aux OSC et garantir l’efficacité des OSC en matière de 
        développement ;
•	Identifier les bonnes pratiques pour un environnement propice aux OSC et l’efficacité des OSC en matière 
        de développement ;
•	Indiquer les avantages qui peuvent découler de la mise en œuvre des bonnes pratiques ;

Spikes, Richard Hornik","Never before has the need for News Literacy been more urgent. As news consumers are bombarded with a constant stream of fake news, propaganda, hoaxes, rumors, satire, and advertising — that often masquerade as credible journalism — it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. While the public’s faith in the news media erodes, purveyors of misinformation have helped give rise to troubling cultural trends and alarming political movements.

This six-week course will help learners develop their critical thinking skills to enable them to better identify reliable information in news reports and to become better informed about the world in which we live. The course will discuss the key elements of journalism from the viewpoint of the news audience.

The language of instruction is English, but Chinese and Spanish subtitles will be available. Each week will tackle a challenge unique to the digital era:

Week 1: The power of information is now in the hands of consumers.
Week 2: What makes journalism different from other types of information?
Week 3: Where can we find trustworthy information?
Week 4: How to tell what’s fair and what’s biased.
Week 5: How to apply news literacy concepts in real life.
Week 6: Meeting the challenges of digital citizenship.",18944.0,8415.0,4.8,211.0

Mobilité et urbanisme,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobiurba,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Vincent Kaufmann, Aniss M. Mezoued, Bernard Declève","Le cours présente un tour d’horizon introductif des interactions entre la mobilité et les dynamiques urbaines. Il propose des outils méthodologiques et opérationnels permettant d’appréhender et de réguler la mobilité.   

Ces vingt dernières années, la mobilité urbaine a beaucoup changé. Le nombre de déplacements de loisirs a augmenté tandis que la part des déplacements pour motif travail a diminué. Dans le même temps, de nouvelles formes de mobilités se sont développées, comme la multirésidentialité, la pendularité de longue distance, le tourisme urbain et l’excursionnisme. Ces changements ont été concommittants de transformations urbaines comme l’étalement urbain ou la fragmentation.

Dans ce contexte, la mobilité est un enjeu pour l’ingénierie des transports urbains et le développement territorial, en particulier urbain: sa régulation nécessite une appréhension nouvelle de la demande de transport.

Le cours montre ainsi aux étudiants les interrelations entre la ville et la mobilité, l’espace urbain et les flux de déplacements, tout en leur offrant une vision renouvelée du transport et de son impact sur le territoire et les modes de vie.",10020.0,5095.0,4.6,110.0
Model Thinking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking,Social Sciences,Economics,Scott E. Page,"We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. 

The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free.

Monetary Policy in the Asia Pacific,https://www.coursera.org/learn/monetary-policy-asia-pacific,Social Sciences,Economics,David Cook,"Watch the introduction video to the course here:  https://youtu.be/U7dQzqtIFVg

The Asia-Pacific region contains some of world’s most dynamic economies. Economies around the globe rely on credible monetary policy implemented by central banking institutions. Monetary policy governs the liquidity available to the payment systems that underlie trade and finance. Smooth adjustment of liquidity can minimize instability in money and foreign exchange markets and keep inflation and growth on a secure footing. The industrial giants of China, Japan, and Korea; the Southeast Asian emerging markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand; and the international entrepots at Hong Kong and Singapore each face unique challenges in implementing liquidity policy.  

This course is for learners with some background information on monetary policy.  This advanced course will build a foundation for understanding liquidity policy implementation in the Asia-Pacific using standard economic models. The course will discuss the effects of high level discussion of a key element of national level public policy, monetary policy.  Modern monetary policy connects macroeconomic conditions and key financial market indicators. It will also analyze the way that central bank goals for macroeconomic stability will determine outcomes in interest rates and exchange rates. The rigorous theoretical foundation should also build analytical skills that might be applied to policy and market analysis in a broad range of economies and even in the Asia-Pacific region as policy-making evolves in the future.

The topics covered each week:

Module 1 - Monetary Policy Implementation
Module 2 - Monetary Policy Strategy
Module 3 - Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy

After taking this course and going through the interactive activities, you will be able to:

(1)  Describe Monetary Policy instruments central banks use
(2)  Interpret on-going actions of central banks
(3)  Apply graphical analysis and calculate basic economic measures used as tools by central banks or analysts

Moral Foundations of Politics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/moral-politics,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Ian Shapiro,"When do governments deserve our allegiance, and when should they be denied it? 

This course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition. In each case, we begin with a look at classical formulations, locating them in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they relate to politics today.

Next, we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations. The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.

In addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay.",187909.0,111409.0,4.9,5209.0

Multilevel Modeling,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlm,Social Sciences,Education,Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities Team,"In this course, PhD candidates will get an introduction into the theory of multilevel modelling, focusing on two level multilevel models with a 'continuous' response variable. In addition, participants will learn how to run basic two-level model in R. 

The objective of this course is to get participants acquainted with multilevel models. These models are often used for the analysis of ‘hierarchical’ data, in which observations are nested within higher level units (e.g. repeated measures nested within individuals, or pupils nested within schools).  In this type of data causes of outcomes (e.g. the performance of pupils in schools) are located both at the level of the individual (e.g., own and parental resources), and at a higher, contextual, level shared by some of the individuals (e.g. characteristics of the class and of the teacher). Because of this, the assumption of 'independent observations' is violated with hierarchical data, but multilevel modelling can easily account for that. Moreover, multilevel modelling can easily deal with missing data (in most circumstances).

Examples of necessary conditions are a student’s GMAT score for admission to a PhD program; a student will not be admitted to a PhD program when his GMAT score is too low. Intelligence for creativity, as creativity will not exist without intelligence, and management commitment for organizational change, as organizational change will not occur without management commitment.
 
NCA can be used with existing or new data sets and can give novel insights for theory and practice. You can apply NCA as a stand-alone approach, or as part of a multi-method approach  complementing multiple linear regression (MLR), structural equation modelling (SEM) or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).
 
This course explains the basic elements of NCA and uses illustrative examples on how to perform NCA with R software. Topics include (i) Setting up an NCA study (ii) Run NCA and (iii) Present the results of NCA.
 
We hope you enjoy the course!",,3470.0,4.8,10.0
Negotiating Learner Differences: Towards Productive Diversity in Learning,https://www.coursera.org/learn/learnerdifferences,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","An investigation of the dimensions of learner diversity: material (class, locale), corporeal (age, race, sex and sexuality, and physical and mental characteristics) and symbolic (culture, language, gender, family, affinity and persona). Examines social-cultural theories of difference, as well as considering alternative responses to these differences in educational settings - ranging from broad, institutional responses to specific pedagogical responses within classes of students. The course also focuses on the application of learning technologies and new media to meet the needs of diverse populations of learners. Its main practical question is, how do we use educational technologies to create learning environments in which learning experiences can be customized and calibrated to meet the precise needs of particular learners? Topics include: universal design for learning, differentiated instruction systems, and adaptive and personalized learning environments.

Network Dynamics of Social Behavior,https://www.coursera.org/learn/networkdynamics,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Damon Centola,"How do revolutions emerge without anyone expecting them?  How did social norms about same sex marriage change more rapidly than anyone anticipated?  Why do some social innovations take off with relative ease, while others struggle for years without spreading?  More generally, what are the forces that control the process of social evolution –from the fashions that we wear, to our beliefs about religious tolerance, to our ideas about the process of scientific discovery and the best ways to manage complex research organizations? 

The social world is complex and full of surprises. Our experiences and intuitions about the social world as individuals are often quite different from the behaviors that we observe emerging in large societies. Even minor changes to the structure of a social network - changes that are unobservable to individuals within those networks - can lead to radical shifts in the spread of new ideas and behaviors through a population. These “invisible” mathematical properties of social networks have powerful implications for the ways that teams solve problems, the social norms that are likely to emerge, and even the very future of our society.  

This course condenses the last decade of cutting-edge research on these topics into six modules.  Each module provides an in-depth look at a particular research puzzle -with a focus on agent-based models and network theories of social change -and provides an interactive computational model for you try out and to use for making your own explorations!  


Learning objectives - after this course, students will be able to...
- explain how computer models are used to study challenging social problems 
- describe how networks are used to represent the structure of social relationships 
- show how individual actions can lead to unintended collective behaviors
- provide concrete examples of how social networks can influence social change 
- discuss how diffusion processes can explain the growth social movements, changes in cultural norms, and the success of team problem solving",11552.0,6445.0,4.6,355.0
New Approaches to Countering Terror: Countering Violent Extremism,https://www.coursera.org/learn/countering-terror-violent-extremism,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Bill Braniff,"The “New Approaches to Countering Terror: Countering Violent Extremism” course offered by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), is a multi-week interactive course designed to help students explore both pragmatic and philosophical challenges that continue to shape the evolution of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), a global security paradigm. START, a Department of Homeland Security Emeritus Center of Excellence and research, training, and education center housed at the University of Maryland within the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS), serves as a leading voice in the national and international dialogue regarding CVE. START’s Director and the course instructor, Bill Braniff, will introduce the concept of CVE and explore the promise of CVE as a more comprehensive and proactive approach to the complex phenomenon of violent extremism.

This 3.5 hour course will take an in-depth look at CVE as a relatively new area of policy and practice. As such, this MOOC can serve as an awareness-raising course, targeting anyone interested in terrorism, community resilience, security, policy and/or civil rights issues. The course is broadly interdisciplinary and has no prerequisites. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Differentiate between two ways of addressing violent extremism: counterterrorism (CT) and Countering Violent Extremism (CVE);
2. Explain the CVE spectrum of non-violent approaches to countering terror, including prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation/reintegration programs;
3. Make sound analytical judgments about CVE programs and their potential.

New Learning: Principles and Patterns of Pedagogy,https://www.coursera.org/learn/newlearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","Education is in a state of flux – transitioning from traditional architectures and practices to new ecologies of teaching and learning influenced by the tremendous social and technological changes of our times. What changes are afoot today in workplaces, civic life and everyday community life? What are their implications for education? What are the possible impacts of contemporary social transformations on teaching and learning - including in the areas of technology, media, globalization, diversity, changing forms of work in the “knowledge society”, and, in these contexts, changing learner needs and sensibilities? This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: “didactic”, “authentic” and “transformative” learning. It takes an historical perspective in order to define the contemporary dimensions of what we term “new learning”. It prepares participants to make purposeful choices and link particular theories/instructional approaches to individual and group learning goals.

Online education: The foundations of online teaching,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-foundations-of-online-teaching,Social Sciences,Education,"A/Professor Iain Hay, Billy Bruce, Jada Bennett","In a world that’s quickly becoming dominated by mobile technology, flexible working opportunities and a post-pandemic economy, online learning is here to stay. This course introduces you to the basics of reimagining, redesigning and optimising face-to-face offerings for the online environment so that learners feel connected, engaged and motivated to learn.

Educators from around the world who are facing these issues in schools, universities and the vocational education sector are finding they need to adapt by upskilling to meet these changing times. This course will introduce you to the key foundational concepts required for teaching online and will explore how technology has fundamentally changed the way education can be delivered and consumed by learners.

The course will cover questions such as: What is online learning and how does it differ from learning in traditional classroom settings? Do the needs of online learners differ from their face-to-face counterparts? How can I design online learning so that it reflects and meets the needs of my learners? Which tools and resources are readily available and easy to master for facilitating engaging and interactive online learning?

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.

Participación eficaz de la sociedad civil en el desarrollo,https://www.coursera.org/learn/participacion-eficaz-de-la-sociedad-civil-en-el-desarrollo,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Sanne Huesken,"Las organizaciones de la sociedad civil (OSC) son actores clave del desarrollo y tienen aportes valiosos que ofrecer. Desempeñan diversas funciones —por ejemplo, en materia de asistencia humanitaria, prestación de servicios, investigación, formulación de políticas, así como asegurar la rendición de cuentas de parte de gobiernos y otros grupos involucrados— todo lo cual puede contribuir significativamente a alcanzar los Objetivos del Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS). Se espera que las OSC desempeñen un papel esencial en la implementación y la supervisión de los ODS. Por consiguiente, es urgente que las OSC tengan una participación eficaz y significativa en los procesos de desarrollo. ¿Qué hace falta, entonces, para que las OSC puedan llevarlo a cabo? La presente Guía interactiva en línea ofrece algunas respuestas a esta pregunta. 

Tras haber completado los 5 módulos de la Guía interactiva en línea, los y las participantes serán capaces de realizar lo siguiente:
•	Describir los motivos de la necesidad de involucrar a la sociedad civil en los procesos de desarrollo.
•	Definir la eficacia del desarrollo y el entorno propicio para las OSC como elementos clave para asegurar la participación eficaz de las OSC en el desarrollo.
•	Recordar los compromisos internacionales con la eficacia del desarrollo y el entorno propicio para las OSC.
•	Distinguir las funciones y responsabilidades de los diversos actores del desarrollo para asegurar la participación de las OSC en el desarrollo eficaz.

Political Economy of Institutions and Development,https://www.coursera.org/learn/political-economy,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Richard Thomas Griffiths,"This course is part of the SDG initiative <http://www.sdginitiative.org/> addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically for the following SDGs [1, 8, 10 and 16]. We hope you will join in our efforts to reach the SDG’s in small but measurable and actionable ways, cooperating with Development Done Differently. Expand your impact. You can create a better world.

In today’s world, politics and economics are interconnected, but what is the nature of this connectivity? What are the power relationships that shape the world economy today and create new challenges for international institutions facing globalization? What makes some countries wealthier than others? Do we face cultural diversity or fragmentation? Does the type of governance effect economic development and social change or is it the other way around? How do we measure it and how trustworthy is the data?  These issues and many more will be examined in this course along with a wide library of sources and a biting criticism.",25834.0,16184.0,4.8,305.0
Politics and Economics of International Energy,https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-energy,Social Sciences,Economics,Giacomo Luciani,"Energy issues have always been important in international relations, but in recent years may have become even more important than in the past due to the widespread awareness of existing limits to energy sources and negative climate impacts. The course discusses global trends in energy consumption and production, various available scenarios for potential developments in the coming decades, the availability of oil reserves and the evolution of the oil industry. It then discusses natural gas and highlights the differences between oil and gas. It will also discuss renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and EU energy policy.

The course aims at providing students whose main interest is in international relations a background on energy resources, technology and economic realities to allow them to correctly interpret the political impact of current developments. It also aims at providing students, who already have a technical background in energy science or engineering, with the broad global view of energy issues that will allow them to better understand the social, economic and political impact of their technical knowledge.

Poverty & Population: How Demographics Shape Policy,https://www.coursera.org/learn/poverty-population-demographics-policy,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,John Robertson,"This course has four modules, or foci.  The first is to understand the categories of social welfare—populations, income, earnings, and assets— and some related concepts that play a very large role in shaping policy decisions: unemployment, inflation, and the minimum wage.  The second deals with the central institution of social welfare—the labor market, which largely determines how many resources a person has.  The labor market also establishes hierarchy, both through meritocracy and through categories of privilege.  The third is poverty: the differing ways we define who is poor, and how effective U.S. anti-poverty efforts have been.  The final module looks directly at federal decision making, the political organization of ideas, the structure of U.S. government, and the legislative process that shapes much of our social policy. This course addresses issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.

The course is part of a sequence in social policy that has an HONORS TRACK. This track will prepare the learner for masters-level work in policy, which involves reading the literature, writing concise summaries and probing critiques. Over the sequence the learner will develop a policy analysis that will create a foundation for professional policy analyst assignments.",5294.0,7013.0,4.8,125.0

Privacy in Europe,https://www.coursera.org/learn/privacy-eu,Social Sciences,Law,Jan Smits,"After having followed Privacy in the Western world you have become acquainted with the overall global legal system and the origins of privacy as a concept as well as privacy as a (human) right. This course deals with the European legal system to protect privacy. European privacy protection is based upon human rights treaties, both on a European level as well global level such as, e.g. the UN Declaration on Human Rights. This course outlines and deals with these human rights treaties as well as with the specific rules and regulations that govern day to day privacy protection in Europe. 

The course deals with how the European cooperation came into being after the devastating effects of World War II. Economic cooperation was deemed necessary to prevent another war. From economic cooperation other issues became part of the negotiations, and to this day more and more policy fields have become part of the European cooperation. Dealing with and having respect for different human rights is paramount in this cooperation. And privacy protection and regulation has become an increasingly important subject that has attracted a lot of global attention. 

The course deals with the different legal elements that have played an important role into grabbing in legal terms the notion of privacy and how to legally protect it. The rules that enable the exchange of personal data between the USA and Europe is being dealt with. It also deals with the constituting legal elements that have become part of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

En este curso, desde la perspectiva de las psicologías del condicionamiento, vamos a explorar cómo nuestros cuerpos aprenden a regular sus respuestas fisiológicas a partir de los estímulos del ambiente (condicionamiento clásico) y cómo nuestras conductas aumentan, disminuyen y se transforman en hábitos o adicciones a partir de sus consecuencias (condicionamiento operante). Desde la perspectiva de la psicología cognitiva, vamos a explorar cómo se adquieren habilidades, cómo usamos estrategias, incorporamos datos y asimilamos conceptos (aprendizajes procedimentales y declarativos) y cómo nuestros valores y creencias acerca del mundo se adquieren de las personas que nos acompañan en la vida (aprendizaje cognitivo social). Finalmente, desde la perspectiva de la psicología humanista, vamos a ver cómo el aprendizaje más significativo, el más apasionado y transformador, surge de la conexión con nuestra propia integridad y de un modo de vincularnos con otros que tiene la capacidad de potenciarnos (aprendizaje centrado en el alumno).

Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 1,https://www.coursera.org/learn/humanitarian-public-health,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Gilbert Burnham, MD, Mija Ververs","This course, Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 1, introduces discussions about the public health approach to problems experienced by people affected by disasters, both natural and related to conflict. The course discusses the many changes which occur in people’s lives when they are uprooted by a disaster, ranging from changes in disease patterns, access to health care, livelihoods, shelter, sanitary conditions, nutritional status, etceteras. We will explore what humanitarian interventions could look like if we want to mitigate the effects of disasters. The course content is a mix of theoretical knowledge and many practical examples from recent disasters. We think this course is unique because it contains so many practical ‘real-life’ examples and is taught by instructors and guest lecturers who together have over 200 years of experience in this field. 

The course consists of 10 modules totaling approximately 9-10 hours of delivered content with an additional 2-3 hours of self-work (quizzes and writing and evaluating a short peer-review assignment) as well as lively discussions forums. The course has been designed in a way that each module builds on the lessons of previous modules. However, you may do the modules in any order and some can be done separately. 

You do not have to pay for this course if you choose to enroll without a certificate. Sometimes referred to as auditing, enrolling without a certificate means that you will have access to all of the videos, quizzes, assignments, and discussions.

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-comparative-analysis,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Fadi Hirzalla,"Welcome to this massive open online course (MOOC) about Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Please read the points below before you start the course. This will help you prepare well for the course and attend it properly. It will also help you determine if the course offers the knowledge and skills you are looking for.

What can you do with QCA?
•	QCA is a comparative method that is mainly used in the social sciences for the assessment of cause-effect relations (i.e. causation). 
•	QCA is relevant for researchers who normally work with qualitative methods and are looking for a more systematic way of comparing and assessing cases. 
•	QCA is also useful for quantitative researchers who like to assess alternative (more complex) aspects of causation, such as how factors work together in producing an effect.
•	QCA can be used for the analysis of cases on all levels: macro (e.g. countries), meso (e.g. organizations) and micro (e.g. individuals).
•	QCA is mostly used for research of small- and medium-sized samples and populations (10-100 cases), but it can also be used for larger groups. Ideally, the number of cases is at least 10. QCA cannot be used if you are doing an in-depth study of one case.

What will you learn in this course?
•	The course is designed for people who have no or little experience with QCA.
•	After the course you will understand the methodological foundations of QCA. 
•	After the course you will know how to conduct a basic QCA study by yourself. 

How is this course organized?
•	The MOOC takes five weeks. The specific learning objectives and activities per week are mentioned in appendix A of the course guide. Please find the course guide under Resources in the main menu. 
•	The learning objectives with regard to understanding the foundations of QCA and practically conducting a QCA study are pursued throughout the course. However, week 1 focuses more on the general analytic foundations, and weeks 2 to 5 are more about the practical aspects of a QCA study.
•	The activities of the course include watching the videos, consulting supplementary material where necessary, and doing assignments. The activities should be done in that order: first watch the videos; then consult supplementary material (if desired) for more details and examples; then do the assignments.
•	There are 10 assignments. Appendix A in the course guide states the estimated time needed to make the assignments and how the assignments are graded. Only assignments 1 to 6 and 8 are mandatory. These 7 mandatory assignments must be completed successfully to pass the course.
•	Making the assignments successfully is one condition for receiving a course certificate. Further information about receiving a course certificate can be found here: https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate 

About the supplementary material
•	The course can be followed by watching the videos. It is not absolutely necessary yet recommended to study the supplementary reading material (as mentioned in the course guide) for further details and examples. Further, because some of the covered topics are quite technical (particularly topics in weeks 3 and 4 of the course), we provide several worked examples that supplement the videos by offering more specific illustrations and explanation. These worked examples can be found under Resources in the main menu.
•	Note that the supplementary readings are mostly not freely available. Books have to be bought or might be available in a university library; journal publications have to be ordered online or are accessible via a university license.
•	The textbook by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) functions as the primary reference for further information on the topics that are covered in the MOOC. Appendix A in the course guide mentions which chapters in that book can be consulted for which week of the course.
•	The publication by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) is comprehensive and detailed, and covers almost all topics discussed in the MOOC. However, for further study, appendix A in the course guide also mentions some additional supplementary literature.
•	Please find the full list of references for all citations (mentioned in this course guide, in the MOOC, and in the assignments) in appendix B of the course guide.",8687.0,9719.0,4.8,118.0

Research for Impact,https://www.coursera.org/learn/research-for-impact,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Mark New, Jesse DeMaria-Kinney","In this course, you will learn more about the Research for Impact approach - a set of principles and practices that will help you to make your research more impactful. Traditionally, the goals and outcomes of research projects were to contribute knowledge and communicate this knowledge through academic publications and journal articles. But If we truly want our research to have an impact, we need to do research differently. Research that influences change in policy, practice, behaviour and attitudes. 

On this six-week journey, Jesse DeMaria-Kinney and Mark New share their experience of the Adaptation at Scale for Semi-arid Regions (ASSAR) Project, where they developed and refined the Research for Impact approach. They are joined by researchers and practitioners who followed this approach in their research. Together you will explore the five elements of the Research for Impact approach, i.e. Theory of Change; Stakeholder Engagement and Strategic Partnerships, Strategic Communication, Capacity Development; and Influencing. You will also get opportunities to hear from researchers and practitioners on the ground who followed this approach, and hopefully become inspired and equipped to incorporate these principles into your own research projects. 

The course is free to enroll and take. You will be offered the option of purchasing a certificate of completion, which you become eligible for if you successfully complete the course requirements.

Resilient Teaching Through Times of Crisis and Change,https://www.coursera.org/learn/resilient-teaching-through-times-of-crisis,Social Sciences,Education,"Rebecca Quintana, PhD","Resilient teaching is the ability to facilitate learning experiences that are designed to be adaptable to fluctuating conditions and disruptions. This teaching ability can be seen as an outcome of a design approach that attends to the relationship between learning goals and activities, and the environments they are situated in. Resilient teaching approaches take into account how a dynamic learning context may require new forms of interactions between teachers, students, content, and tools. Additionally, they necessitate the capacity to rethink the design of learning experiences based on a nuanced understanding of context. 

The course is designed with higher education faculty, lecturers, and graduate student instructors in mind, but may also be applicable to educators in a wide variety of instructional environments. The course is aimed at participants who may be asked to rethink how they teach in the immediate or near future due to the ever-changing circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the creation of this course is motivated by the current crisis, we expect it will remain relevant to instructors who are faced with disruptions and change to their teaching for any number of reasons and must quickly adapt their course designs.

To support learning and reflection, we are introducing a new journaling tool within the course that provides a place for participants to reflect on their own experiences. To support community growth, participants can choose to share their journal entries with the wider course community in an interactive gallery space.",5529.0,4531.0,4.8,53.0

Responding to student writing gives teachers one of the most meaningful avenues to help students learn and grow. In this module, learners will identify best practices in effectively responding to student writing. You will also define revision, identify how revision differs from editing, and examine strategies for teaching students how to engage in effective revision. Finally, because writing can also be used for testing, and because all students learn in increments over time, learners will identify a number of strategies for evaluating and assessing student writing, both for individual writings and a student writer’s progress over a period of time. Learners will also consider ways to involve students in both the responding and assessment processes. At the conclusion of this course, learners will have a toolbox full of strategies and practices for these three significant components of any writing class: responding to, revising and assessing student writing.",,2715.0,,

Science Communication: Communicating Trustworthy Information in the Digital World,https://www.coursera.org/learn/communicating-trustworthy-information-in-the-digital-world,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Jason H. Pridmore, Marina Tulin","In a world of information overload, how does one find reliable information? Science is supposed to be the answer to our society's complicated challenges. However, as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, not understanding what is fake news, misinformation or what is fact may lead to widespread public mistrust, or turn science into fuel for conspiracy theories or propaganda. Scientific findings are prone to change, making it difficult to effectively communicate them to the public. This fosters broad public skepticism towards major institutions, from the government to media to science. So, how can we communicate science effectively? And how can we rebuild trust in science? As a result, it is critical that we reconsider our science communication practices to recover public trust.

This course offers a current overview of science communication. We cover a wide range of topics like fake news, mis- or disinformation, but also how to combat these practices. We explore how major stakeholders (scientists, policymakers, science communicators and citizens) can work together to improve science communication. And we tackle how people and organizations can earn and maintain public trust via effective science communication. We recommend this course to scientists, journalists, policymakers or any learners interested in science communication.

Security & Safety Challenges in a Globalized World,https://www.coursera.org/learn/security-safety-globalized-world,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Bibi  van den Berg, Ruth Prins","Security and safety challenges rank among the most pressing issues of modern times. Challenges such as, cyber-crime, terrorism, and environmental disasters impact the lives of millions across the globe. These issues also rank high on the agenda of politicians, international organizations and businesses. They also feature prominently in the public conscience and in governmental policies. 

In the current, interconnected world, security challenges are becoming increasingly complex. Facilitated by developments as globalization and the spread of networked and hyper-connected technologies, new safety and security challenges arise and impact local, national, regional and international levels, which dramatically increases their complexity and scale. As such, solutions to contemporary security challenges require a wide array of actors operating on multiple levels of governance.

The course will introduce you to the broad theme of security and safety in an increasingly complex world. Together we will search for answers to important questions: what is security and safety? How can we understand complex modern-day security and safety challenges?  And how do we deal with such challenges?  This course combines scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from terrorism studies, to crisis management, to medical science) with real-life cases to explore and understand complex modern-day safety and security challenges.",24454.0,23698.0,4.8,357.0

Ante este escenario, la comunidad internacional ha decidido establecer como una de sus más altas prioridades alcanzar la seguridad hídrica. En un ambiente de seguridad hídrica:

1. La población tiene acceso a agua potable en cantidad y calidad adecuadas y a un precio justo para solventar sus necesidades básicas de consumo, saneamiento, higiene y salud. Esta condición favorece su desarrollo integral y le permite hacer valer todos sus derechos humanos.

2. Los ecosistemas son aprovechados de manera sustentable para que puedan seguir brindando sus servicios
ambientales, de los cuales dependen tanto las personas como la naturaleza.

3. Existe un adecuado abastecimiento de agua para la producción de alimentos y de energía, así como para la
industria, el transporte y el turismo.

4. La población es resiliente a los efectos relacionados con los fenómenos hidrometeorológicos extremos, incluyendo inundaciones, sequías y transporte de contaminantes.

Hacer realidad un ambiente de seguridad hídrica no es tarea sencilla, por ello, en este curso analizarás cada uno
de los elementos contenidos en este nuevo paradigma, revisarás los principales retos que enfrentamos para alcanzarlo y conocerás algunas iniciativas que son empleadas en la actualidad para dar solución a los problemas relacionados con los recursos hídricos.

For some scholars the 21st century globe will see the most significant change of human history - the move of most of the world to live in cities - a planetary urbanism that has changed the way we live globally, the way we organise ourselves economically and the impact humanity has on our environment in an age that we consequently now describe as the Anthropocene.

Most of the urban growth on the planet will be in the global South and this is where we concentrate the attention of this course, drawing on the work of a five-year programme known as PEAK Urban, involving a collaboration of researchers from China, Colombia, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

The PEAK Urban programme aims to aid decision-making on urban futures by:
•	Generating new research grounded in the logic of urban complexity;
•	Fostering the next generation of leaders that draw on different perspectives and backgrounds to address the greatest urban challenges of the 21st century;
•	Growing the capacity of cities to understand and plan their own future.

Shaping Urban Futures aims to demonstrate how complementary research projects have applied the PEAK Urban framework – Prediction, Emergence, Adoption and Knowledge – to uncover interrelated issues of health, climate change, migration and informality in places that will face the biggest challenges from rapid unplanned urbanisation.

This course consists of 6 modules, with an Introduction and a Closing module sandwiching 4 core modules. Each module involves around 5-6 hours of learning. To get the best out of the course, learners are encouraged to view all the video lectures and conversations, go through other learning material, work on all the assignments and assessments, and participate in discussions in a constructive and respectful manner. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
•	Recognise the new urban sciences that are driving our understanding of urbanisation across the world
•	Examine carefully how we should understand how to trace, examine and explore the ways new social, economic and environmental changes emerge and reshape the working of the city
•	Visualise how technological change is adopted, adapted and deployed differently in variable city contexts
•	Understand how best to intervene in urban futures through sharing urban experiences and contributing to the coproduction of knowledge to enrich and strengthen knowledge exchange in cities

This course is designed principally for people working in cities who want to make a difference and for all urban scholars, from early career researchers to veteran urbanists and everyone in between. This course will also hopefully inspire workers in local government, community organisations and the private sector as well as urban scholars to build upon the experiences of a global network to develop their own methods and frames to view, interpret and define urban changes in their local geographies and contexts.",,11440.0,,

This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.
In this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems. Over the journey of this 5-week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of Smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors. 
This course does not have any prerequisites. However, to take the most away from of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners. 
Through this course, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;
- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems;
- Study the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and
- Understand potential applications of the materials learned in this course within the context of the management of smart urban transportation systems as well as smart urban energy systems.",42244.0,33380.0,4.7,1568.0

"Social Norms, Social Change I",https://www.coursera.org/learn/norms,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Cristina Bicchieri,"This is a course on social norms, the rules that glue societies together. It teaches how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors.  The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage, gender violence and sanitation practices. 

This is Part 1 of the Social Norms, Social Change series. In these lectures, I introduce all the basic concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences, that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement is crucial to understanding the nature of the practice you are facing, as well as whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why. In Part 2, we will put into practice all we have learned in Part 1.

This course addresses issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.

-The first module identifies the needs of children and the role of the state in child development.  We will explore changes in the family and the resulting debates about how to best support families and child development.  We’ll appraise family leave and child care programs for their role in supporting paid work and in strengthening child development, as well as income support efforts including the child tax credit and proposals for a family allowance.  

-The second module begins with a description of child poverty—both the forces leading to it, and its effects.  This module also describes public support programs and critiques the debates surrounding them.

-The third module focuses on persons living with disabilities, evaluating the  landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.   We will also critique the processes of establishing a disability social insurance program and the public aid programs that make people with disabilities eligible for income support and health support.  

-The final module begins with a report on the aging of the U.S. population.  Building on this, we’ll examine social insurance programs and public aid programs for seniors for their longterm viability, and assess the various reforms that have been proposed to stabilize these programs.

Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences - Unit 1: Historical Foundations,https://www.coursera.org/learn/soulbeliefs,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Prof. Daniel M. Ogilvie, Prof. Leonard W. Hamilton","Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.

The course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.

The Social Dimensions of Antimicrobial Resistance,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-social-dimensions-of-antimicrobial-resistance,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Danny de Vries, Luisa Toro-Alzate","Sonar-Global is a collaborative work to mobilize social sciences against infectious threats. It is a sustainable international network to strengthen the active participation of the social sciences in the prevention and response to infectious threats, including those posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and vaccine hesitancy. 

The Sonar-Global's Social Dimensions of Antimicrobial Resistance MOOC is an independent course for non-social scientists who want to know more about the social dimensions of AMR. Furthermore, the course is also the basis for the OPERATE-SOC AMR curriculum, which is a curriculum developed for trainers who need to provide interdisciplinary training about the social dimensions of antimicrobial resistance to non-social scientists.  This MOOC includes lectures on important social science dimensions by 19 social science experts in the field of AMR, and it has been fully developed by social scientists. 

The training objectives of this MOOC are: 
•	To provide a guided introduction to the social dimensions of AMR 
•	To learn about the relevance of social science perspectives and approaches in the study of AMR
•	To get introduced to the need for interdisciplinary collaboration with social scientists when working on AMR
•	To serve as a basis for the Sonar-Global OPERATE-SOC curriculum

"The Sustainable Development Goals – A global, transdisciplinary vision for the future",https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-sustainable-development,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Katherine Richardson,"In 2015, the UN launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted by 193 member states, the goals represent an important international step in setting humanity on a trajectory towards sustainable development. Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs – what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. 

While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.

"Time to Reorganize! Understand Organizations, Act, and Build a Meaningful World.",https://www.coursera.org/learn/orgology,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,Rodolphe Durand,"We are in constant relationship with many organizations. Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.

Do you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? 

Organizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.

This course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  

In turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.

There is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etc… will benefit a lot from this course.

For the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners. He will be offering ""office hours"" sessions through google hangouts and answering learner questions from the forums. We hope this direct interaction will add to your learner experience!

We’ll use insights from movie-making—not to mention from odd visual tricks in Barb’s kitchen—to see how students learn, both independently and together. We all know, for example, that social learning is valuable in helping students grapple with tough concepts as well as in making learning more fun. But if you understand what is happening in the brain during social learning, you can also understand why certain approaches commonly used in online learning, such as discussion forums, can sometimes pose a challenge.  As you will see, we can use insights from neuroscience not only to motivate our students, but to help them change their very identity.  

Our course is designed for university professors,  vocational instructors, K-12 teachers, coaches, business trainers, parents, and in fact, anyone who is trying to teach concepts or skills online. We're not just talking about traditional academic materials—if you’ve ever considered teaching a course on Udemy, putting up a video series on YouTube, or launching your own educational blog, this course is also for you. An essential and exciting point is that students can learn even BETTER online than they can in the traditional face-to-face classroom. That’s whether you’re teaching synchronously—that is, live, via a platform like Zoom; or you’re teaching asynchronously—that is, any time—by having videos and other teaching materials accessible to students whenever they want. 

You can take this course independently from the other two ""Uncommon Sense Teaching"" courses in this specialization—some of the neuroscience- and cognitive-psychology-based insights we’ll mention here in simple ways are explored more deeply in those other courses. So feel free to take the other two courses in the specialization in conjunction with or after this course. If you’ve already taken the other two courses, you’ll find that this course reviews and extends the practical insights from neuroscience you’ve already received in unexpected new directions. And you’ll find even deeper insights we haven’t covered before.

In TEACHING ONLINE you'll be joining a trio of experienced online instructors who have taught millions in some of the world's most popular online courses.  One of our deepest goals for this course is to help YOU to teach others to improve their ability to reach and teach students.

By learning how Europe works, a new world will open up to you and 

discover new jobs you never heard of.

The European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of everybody’s life. We will analyze what the EU is doing for YOU regardless of where you live. We will also look at what YOU can do for and in Europe.

Whether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. 

While the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, in 50 years it accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize. The EU remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history.

Given its inherent complexities, this Course aims at empowering you on what Europe can offer and will enable you to discover jobs and opportunities you were not aware of. Indeed, throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You will also be able to interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content.",25056.0,11151.0,4.5,219.0

Understanding child development: from synapse to society,https://www.coursera.org/learn/child-development,Social Sciences,Education,dr. Jorg Huijding,"In this course, we dive into the topic of child development. You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.

In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.

To illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.

"Unión Europea: Historia, Instituciones y Políticas",https://www.coursera.org/learn/ue-historia-instituciones-politicas,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Ana Mar Fernández Pasarín, Concepció Muñoz Ruiz, Andrea Noferini","La Unión Europea (UE) representa una de las experiencias más avanzadas en materia de integración económica y unión política a escala global. Desde su surgimiento en los años 50 del siglo XX hasta la explosión de la actual pandemia provocada por el COVID-19, la UE no ha cesado de ampliar su radio de acción llegando a difuminar, en muchas áreas, la tradicional distinción entre asuntos internos y externos de los Estados nacionales.

Aún, debiendo hacer frente a un número creciente de posiciones críticas y escépticas respecto al proceso de integración, la Unión sigue siendo un referente clave para los ciudadanos. Así lo refleja, por ejemplo, el Eurobarómetro de junio de 2020, en el que el 66% de los europeos consideraba que la UE debería tener más competencias para combatir los efectos de la pandemia.

Ante las contradicciones de la globalización, comprender cómo estos procesos de cesión progresiva de soberanía y puesta en común de la toma de decisiones producen efectos reales sobre la ciudadanía constituye uno de los retos más interesantes de las ciencias políticas, las relaciones internacionales y el análisis de las políticas públicas. 

El principal objetivo de este curso consiste en ilustrar el funcionamiento de la UE como sistema político sui generis, mediante un análisis crítico y detallado de su origen y desarrollo histórico, diseño institucional y principales políticas públicas.

El curso se dirige a un público amplio que quiere aprender y entender de qué manera se definen e implementan las políticas públicas a escala europea y doméstica, cuáles son sus principales actores, así como las dinámicas que rigen las relaciones entre las instituciones de la UE y los gobiernos de los Estados miembros. 

Los módulos han sido diseñados con el objetivo de ofrecer una visión de conjunto sobre el proceso de integración, a partir del análisis de los principales hitos históricos, del rol de cada una de las principales instituciones de la UE y del impacto del derecho europeo en las arenas nacionales. Complementando, además, la perspectiva teórica con las visiones más aplicadas del proceso de integración, el curso selecciona algunas de los ámbitos políticos más relevantes para observar la ‘UE en acción’, tanto a nivel interno (por ejemplo, economía, política agraria, política de cohesión o política ambiental), como a nivel externo (posición internacional de la UE, cooperación al desarrollo, comercio exterior, entre otros).

Villes africaines : Restructuration des quartiers précaires,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bidonvilles,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Isagha Diagana, Jérôme Chenal","L’objet de ce cours est l’étude de la restructuration des quartiers précaires des villes africaines. Il s’agit, en partant de la compréhension de leur formation, de leur organisation et de leur fonctionnement, d’examiner les modes d’intervention qui visent leur revalorisation et intégration dans les structures formelles des villes qui les accueillent.

La croissance rapide des villes s’est accompagnée, sur l’ensemble des continents, de mécanismes parfois déroutants de production urbaine qui ont mis à mal les équilibres territoriaux et sociaux des agglomérations. 

A  l’heure actuelle, près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde, vivent dans des quartiers précaires, en raison des mauvaises conditions d’accueil et de la pénurie de logements. Cela est particulièrement vrai des villes africaines, où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.

L’existence et l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes à intégrer les populations pauvres, en même temps qu’elles révèlent les limites des politiques urbaines à planifier et réguler le développement des grandes agglomérations. La question est devenue si préoccupante que la question de la restructuration des quartiers précaires dépasse aujourd’hui le cadre strict d’une intervention physique pour se poser comme une question de développement à part entière.

Quelle lecture peut-on faire de l’existence et de la prolifération des quartiers précaires en Afrique? Quelles ont été, jusqu’ici, les approches et réponses apportées par les gouvernants et les bailleurs? Quels modes et quels outils ont été expérimentés pour leur restructuration?

Celui-ci est marqué depuis les indépendances par des crises climatiques et économiques qui entrainent des mouvements de migration des campagnes vers les villes, l’entrée de l’informel dans l’économie urbaine et une réduction des ressources budgétaires des Etats qui impacte l'investissement dans les services sociaux de base y compris le transport. Dans un second temps, le cours va explorer la théorie de la mobilité comme stratégie d’accès à la ville. Pour ce faire il analysera les stratégies de mobilité dans les villes africaines aussi bien résidentielles que quotidiennes et selon les catégories socioéconomiques.

Public and private stakeholders who are active in this field must develop new ways to better manage the water cycle ""as a whole"".

The objective of this MOOC is to develop an understanding of the problems related to water management. Firstly, this course will define a resource and, more specifically, the resource of water. It will look at how water is used and the activities associated with it as well as any potential conflicts. The course will look at water management in detail through the analysis of the different types of rights and obligations associated with, for example, the development of a multi-sectorial regulation system or a watershed management approach.

By the end of this course, our aim is to enable you to:
1) Identify the main issues and strategies linked to water resource management
2) Acquire the key reading material needed to understand the many variables (environmental, institutional and political) which affect water and which, in terms of management, may require adjustment.

This course was developed by the Geneva Water Hub. Alongside researchers from the University of Geneva from a range of faculties, researchers from other universities and research centres will be involved in this course. Practitioners who deal daily with the political dimension of water management will also input into the course.

This MOOC is designed for all those interested in the water sector. Prior training is not necessary to follow our program. The findings presented in this course can be easily reapplied to different contexts and to different scales of analysis.

This MOOC is supported by the Geneva Water Hub and the University of Geneva along with the MOOC in « Ecosystem Services: a Method for Sustainable Development » (www.coursera.org/learn/ecosystem-services) and the one in ""International Water Law"" (www.coursera.org/learn/droit-eau).

Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries Part 2: Developing Effective Interventions,https://www.coursera.org/learn/water-part-2,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"Dr Duncan Thomas, Prof Dale Whittington","Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries Part 2 is our second MOOC in a two-part sequence, and looks at ‘Developing Effective Interventions’. Here we invite you to develop analytical skills and deep understanding about a complex, controversial policy problem – one with no simple, easy answers. About half a billion people on our planet still lack access to improved water supplies and about two billion do not have improved sanitation services, leading to an unknown but very large number of avoidable deaths each year from water-related diseases. Millions of dollars are spent on avoidable health care expenditures, and people – mostly women – spend many billions of hours carrying water from sources outside the home. Reducing these costs is a major global challenge for us all in the 21st century. Join us to explore the challenging and complex political, economic, social, and technical dimensions of the policy interventions that donors, national governments and water utilities use to address this challenge. This second MOOC consists of the following seven sessions:

•	Session 1: Introduction and how our ‘ancient instincts’ affect water policy interventions.
•	Session 2: Planning better policy interventions: Roles, features and examples of planning protocols.
•	Session 3: Water pricing, tariff design and subsidies.
•	Session 4: Providing information to households and communities to improve water and sanitation conditions.
•	Session 5: Changing the institutions that deliver water and sanitation services: Privatization in developing countries.
•	Session 6: Changing institutions: Lessons from the UK water privatization story.
•	Session 7: Changing institutions: Improving regulation of the water and sanitation sector.

Your instructors for this course have worked in and studied this sector for many years. Professor Dale Whittington has worked on water and sanitation policy and planning issues for over 40 years in more than two dozen low and middle-income countries. Dr Duncan Thomas has worked in the UK and European water sectors for 15 years, focusing on overcoming barriers to technological, organizational, regulatory and policy innovations.

Welcome to Game Theory,https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-introduction,Social Sciences,Economics,Michihiro Kandori,"This course provides a brief introduction to game theory. Our main goal is to understand the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. The course uses very little mathematics, and it is ideal for those who are looking for a conceptual introduction to game theory.

Business competition, political campaigns, the struggle for existence by animals and plants, and so on, can all be regarded as a kind of “game,” in which individuals try to do their best against others. Game theory provides a general framework to describe and analyze how individuals behave in such “strategic” situations.

This course focuses on the key concepts in game theory, and attempts to outline the informal basic ideas that are often hidden behind mathematical definitions. Game theory has been applied to a number of disciplines, including economics, political science, psychology, sociology, biology, and computer science. Therefore, a warm welcome is extended to audiences from all fields who are interested in what game theory is all about.",82667.0,24715.0,4.7,1875.0
What are the Chances? Probability and Uncertainty in Statistics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/chances-probability-uncertainty-statistics,Social Sciences,Economics,"Jennifer Bachner, PhD","This course focuses on how analysts can measure and describe the confidence they have in their findings.  The course begins with an overview of the key probability rules and concepts that govern the calculation of uncertainty measures.  We’ll then apply these ideas to variables (which are the building blocks of statistics) and their associated probability distributions.  The second half of the course will delve into the computation and interpretation of uncertainty.  We’ll discuss how to conduct a hypothesis test using both test statistics and confidence intervals.  Finally, we’ll consider the role of hypothesis testing in a regression context, including what we can and cannot learn from the statistical significance of a coefficient.  By the end of the course, you should be able to discuss statistical findings in probabilistic terms and interpret the uncertainty of a particular estimate.",1756.0,4512.0,4.7,10.0

The critique will be developed through engagement with theories and ideas developed through educational research. You will be encouraged to use these ideas to challenge or support your own ideas about education.   

Each week we will focus on one key question, using video lectures, key readings and challenges to explore some commonplace notions about education. With the guidance of the course team, you will be asked to use these ideas to critically reflect on your own understandings and experience. By the end of the course, you will have developed a personal response to the main question: what is your preferred future for education?",52616.0,14678.0,4.7,703.0
Writing and Disseminating Grey Literature,https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-and-disseminating-grey-literature,Social Sciences,Education,"Rekha Raghunathan, Archita Suryanarayanan, Yashodara Udupa, Kaavya Pradeep Kumar, Shobita Rao","If you are a  researcher, academic, student, development sector professional or a practitioner who is keen to reach the research-based knowledge you have created to a wider audience, this course is for you.

Vast amounts of knowledge are produced by educational and research institutions through rigorous research and fieldwork. Yet, there is a dearth of access to this knowledge among non-academic communities (which includes practitioners, policymakers, and citizens) due to the language used. Researchers can bring visibility to grey literature if they engage with alternate public writing forms.

Newer platforms for knowledge dissemination across digital, print, and multimedia channels have made information from grey literature more available and accessible to lay readers. Using formats such as data stories, photo narratives, opinion pieces and infographics, these platforms can help researchers reach a much wider audience when they adopt newer writing techniques.

This course will:
* Provide an overview of data stories, photo narratives, opinion pieces and infographics produced from grey literature
* Teach methods to craft such pieces
* Explain how to pitch to media outlets
* Teach how social media can be leveraged to draw greater visibility to publications",,,,
e-Learning Ecologies: Innovative Approaches to Teaching and Learning for the Digital Age,https://www.coursera.org/learn/elearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.

But what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?

This course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:

1. Ubiquitous Learning
2. Active Knowledge Making
3. Multimodal Meaning
4. Recursive Feedback
5. Collaborative Intelligence
6. Metacognition
7. Differentiated Learning

These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.

理解马克思,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ma-ke-si,Social Sciences,Governance and Society,"张 亮, 周 嘉昕, 孙 乐强","不管是赞同还是反对，卡尔 • 马克思（1818-1883）已经成为我们这个时代人类共有的精神财产。法国解构主义思想家雅克 • 德里达（1930-2004）因此宣称：“全世界的男男女女们，不论愿意与否，甚至知道与否，他们今天在某种程度上都是马克思和马克思主义的继承人。” 

本课程将在一种当代视野中简要勾画马克思的思想历程，进而以《1844年经济学哲学手稿》、《共产党宣言》、《资本论》这三种著作为中心，在比较的视野中阐发理解马克思的方法，展现马克思的思想世界及其当代影响。

学习者将主要通过观看教学视频（每一讲含5-8段教学视频，每段教学视频8-16分钟左右）、阅读教辅材料（原著节选、期刊论文），并结合相关作业练习以及测试的形式进行自学。

Whether approving or not, Karl·Marx(1818-1883) has become the common spiritual wealth of human in our time. Therefore, as Jacques Derrida said: ‘Whether they wish it or know it or not, all men and women, all over the earth, are today to a certain extent the heirs of Marx and Marxism.’
The course will briefly delineate Marx’s thought process in a contemporary view, and center on these three core works of Marx :‘Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844’ , ‘the communist manifesto’ and ‘Capital’, to interpret and understand Marx’s method in a comparative perspective, showing Marx’s thoughts and its contemporary influence.",9212.0,3919.0,4.3,60.0
