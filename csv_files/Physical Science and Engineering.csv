(Non) Status quo Attitudes with NetLogo,https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonstatusquo-attitudes-netlogo,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,Danilo Oliveira Vaz,"Have you ever wondered what is behind different cultural traits and attitudes towards the status quo? Or more broadly, what influences the Zeitgeist of a society? Generally speaking, when it comes to changing (or not) the current spirit and state of affairs of a given society or community, some people show themselves as idealists, and they can even inspire others. At the same time, some other people are traditionalists, and some are just neutral about how things are. In this guided-project you will develop an agent-based model using NetLogo that tries to use these personas to touch and generate insights around theses questions. And while doing so, you will gain some hands-on knowledge on model building and debugging.

Note: This project works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",,,,
21st Century Energy Transition: how do we make it work?,https://www.coursera.org/learn/21st-century-energy-transition,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Brad Hayes,"Affordable, abundant and reliable energy is fundamental to human well-being and prosperity. For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels – coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important – and sometimes conflicting – drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earth’s environments. 

In this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (“realities”) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",,19180.0,,

A Circular Economy of Metals: Towards a Sustainable Societal Metabolism,https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Ester van der Voet,"Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.  

A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  

In this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  

This course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world.

Advanced Capstone Spacecraft Dynamics and Control Project,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-capstone-spacecraft-dynamics-control-project,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Hanspeter Schaub,"This capstone course is the 3rd and final course of the specialization Advanced Spacecraft Dynamics and Control. It assumes you have completed the prior courses on ""Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices"" and ""Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics"".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.

First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.

Next, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.",,,,

In classical thermodynamics, the actual course of the process is not the primary concern, and often is ignored. A state of thermodynamic equilibrium endures unchangingly unless it is interrupted by a thermodynamic operation that initiates a thermodynamic process.(2) A cyclic process carries the system through a cycle of stages, starting and being completed in some particular state. The descriptions of the staged states of the system are not the primary concern.(3) Defined by flows through a system, a flow process is a steady state of flows into and out of a vessel with definite wall properties.

AstroTech: The Science and Technology behind Astronomical Discovery,https://www.coursera.org/learn/astronomy-technology,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,"Andy Lawrence, Catherine Heymans","""How do they know that?""

Modern astronomy has made some astonishing discoveries - how stars burn and how black holes form; galaxies from the edge of the universe and killer rocks right next door; where the elements come from and how the expanding universe is accelerating. But how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.

Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result. We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with some basic physics, how we interpret the data to make scientific discoveries.

The class will consist of video lectures, weekly quizzes, and discussion forums. Each week there will be five videos, totalling approximately 40 minutes. They will be in a regular pattern - a short introduction, an example science story, an explanation of the key technology area, a look at how the technology is used in practice, and finally a look at what the future may hold.",16251.0,8907.0,4.7,1018.0

CAM and Design Manufacturing for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cam-design-manufacturing-mechanical-engineers,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Autodesk,"With design for manufacturing, our design process focused on the design over its cost, but always keeping in mind how parts needed to be made. With manufacturing at the core of a design, we're able to fix potential problems in the design phase rather than after production. In many cases, the end product is made up of an assembly of different pieces to simplify manufacturing or to achieve specific design goals. Each piece represents a certain tolerance and put together, things might not work or fit if they weren’t accounted for in the design. 

We'll take a closer look at design and detail for manufacture and create toolpaths to cut parts. Even if the end goal as an engineer isn’t to fabricate your own parts, it’s a valuable skill to understand how things are made and what design decisions can ultimately affect how something is created.   

After taking this course, you'll be able to: 

- Inspect a multicomponent assembly.
- Identify manufacturing methods based on part inspection.
- Create detailed drawings for manufacturing.
- Practice creating toolpaths for manufacture.

This success has arisen because chemical biology straddles a nexus between chemistry, biology, and physics. Thus, chemical biology can harness rapid chemistry to observe or perturb biological processes, that are in turn reported using physical assays, all in an otherwise unperturbed living entity. 

Although its boundaries are endless, the multidisciplinary nature of chemical biology can make the field seem daunting; we beg to differ!

Climate Adaptation in Africa,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-adaptation,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Mark New,"This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa.

The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.",5778.0,9676.0,4.8,84.0

Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-changes-mountains-water,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Martin Beniston, Markus Stoffel","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? 

Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

Además, siempre ha estado interesado en que éstos lleven a cabo la tarea por sí mismos, sin necesidad de una supervisión continua. En nuestros días, muchos dispositivos llevan a cabo tareas como por arte de magia; pareciera que piensan o que adivinan nuestros deseos, que nunca se pueden equivocar o que su precisión y velocidad no puede ser superada. Los sistemas de control son una parte crucial de este funcionamiento. 

Con este curso, los participantes conocerán la aplicación de los sistemas de control y algunos ejemplos de ellos. Además, revisarán a grandes rasgos sus características básicas y sus diferentes representaciones, con especial énfasis en el modelado matemático.

Você aprenderá a obter o diagrama de Bode a partir de dados de amplitude e fase de entradas e saídas senoidais. Também será capaz de esboçar o diagrama de Bode de um sistema dada a sua função de transferência. Outrossim, será capaz de representar a resposta em frequência na carta de Nichols-Black.

A fim de se determinar a estabilidade do sistema, você aprenderá a aplicar o critério de Nyquist, que faz uso da resposta em frequência em malha aberta e permite determinar se um sistema será estável em malha fechada.
Ao fim do curso, você será capaz de projetar controladores com dinâmica, isto é, com polos e zeros, portanto mais complexos do que um simples ganho de realimentação. Essa flexibilidade permitirá que você projete controladores para satisfazer simultaneamente requisitos de sobressinal e tempo de resposta que seriam impossíveis de atender com um simples ganho. Também poderá com isso alterar as características da resposta em regime estacionário, aumentando as constantes de erro sem alterar (muito) a resposta transitória.

São apresentadas técnicas para lidar com implementação de controladores por computador, requerendo a consideração da discretização do tempo inerente aos seu uso. A importância dos conhecimentos apresentados nesse curso se justifica pela onipresença de controladores digitais em aplicações atualmente.

O curso é dividido em 4 módulos, resumidamente:
1) Apresentação de modelos para sistemas operando a tempo discreto e critérios para avaliar sua estabilidade.
2) Formas de discretizar aproximadamente uma função de transferência a tempo contínuo e estimação do efeito da discretização na resposta do sistema.
3) Projeto do controlador diretamente em tempo discreto, usando duas abordagens: resposta em frequência e Lugar Geométrico das Raízes (LGR).
4) Projeto do controlador diretamente em tempo discreto, usando o espaço de estados.
Ao longo do curso, ferramentas computacionais de projeto de controladores auxiliado por computador são usadas para ilustrar a aplicação das técnicas através de exemplos. Apesar de ser possível concluir o curso prescindindo dessas ferramentas, seu uso é recomendado por dois motivos: facilidade de realizar as operações mais tediosas, liberando mais tempo para focar no conteúdo, e aproximação com o que é feito na prática de projetos no âmbito de atuação do(a) profissional.
Ao final desse curso, o(a) aluno(a) deve ser capaz de adaptar criteriosamente um projeto de controlador feito a tempo contínuo para aplicação em sistemas controlador por computador digital e projetar diretamente um controlador a tempo discreto para o mesmo uso.",1508.0,1554.0,,

Você também será capaz de projetar controladores de avanço de fase para atender simultaneamente requisitos de desempenho de amortecimento e de velocidade da resposta. Você também será capaz de projetar controladores de atraso de fase para atender requisitos de erro em regime permanente sem alterar as características de estabilidade e da resposta transitória do sistema. Você verá que os controladores PD e PI podem ser considerados como casos especiais dos controladores de avanço e de atraso de fase e verá também que você pode combinar os dois tipos de controladores em controladores de avanço e atraso de fase ou em controladores PID.
Por fim você será capaz de modelar o efeito do atraso de transporte em um sistema com realimentação e de contrapor esse efeito projetando um controlador ou fazendo ajustes em um controlador já projetado.

"Dense Gases, Liquids and Solids",https://www.coursera.org/learn/dense-gases-liquids-solids,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,John W. Daily,"Course 4 of Statistical Thermodynamics addresses dense gases, liquids, and solids. As the density of a gas is increased, intermolecular forces begin to affect behavior. For small departures from ideal gas behavior, known as the dense gas limit, one can estimate the change in properties using the concept of a configuration integral, a modification to the partition function. This leads to the development of equations of state that are expansions in density from the ideal gas limit. Inter molecular potential energy functions are introduced and it is explored how they impact P-V-T behavior. As the density is increased, there is a transition to the liquid state. We explore whether this transition is smooth or abrupt by examining the stability of a thermodynamic system to small perturbations. We then present a brief discussion regarding the determination of the thermodynamic properties of liquids using concept of the radial distribution function (RDF), and how the function relates to thermodynamic properties. Finally, we explore two simple models of crystalline solids.",4747.0,2242.0,4.5,109.0

Optical instruments are how we see the world, from corrective eyewear to medical endoscopes to cell phone cameras to orbiting telescopes. This course extends what you have learned about first-order, paraxial system design and optical resolution and efficiency with the introduction to real lenses and their imperfections. We begin with a description of how different wavelengths propagate through systems, then move on to aberrations that appear with high angle, non-paraxial systems and how to correct for those problems. The course wraps up with a discussion of optical components beyond lenses and an excellent example of a high-performance optical system – the human eye. The mathematical tools required for analysis of high-performance systems are complicated enough that this course will rely more heavily on OpticStudio by Zemax.

Designing Effective Science Communication,https://www.coursera.org/learn/designing-effective-science-communication,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,Melanie Peffer,"Although many would prefer to leave science in the past and no longer engage with it once completing compulsory science classes in school, the reality is that engaging with science is an integral part of our daily lives. Moreover, for the safety and wellness of human society, it is necessary to engage with scientific information. We are faced with the necessity of examining scientific evidence on topics ranging from conservation to public health and make decisions that impact not only our families but those around us. However, in spite of decades of science education reform and dedicated efforts to improving science literacy, many members of the general public lack the confidence, skills, or interest in engaging with scientific issues, instead choosing to align their scientific decisions with non-scientific stakeholders, such as political or pop culture figures. These problems are ongoing and destructive. How do we communicate science more effectively with the general public? With other scientists? 

This course is designed for scientists, science educators, and science communicators who are interested in re-thinking how we communicate science to diverse audiences, particularly to the general public. Topics include evidence-based considerations of human learning as well as effective communication through a variety of modalities, including oral presentations, written forms of communication, technology, and artistic media. The objective of this course is to equip learners with the skills needed to design and implement effective methods of science communication. Learners will be able to identify key principles of human learning that undergird science communication, describe pitfalls in “popular” avenues for science outreach, and apply best practices to science communication in a variety of media.",2292.0,6000.0,4.5,18.0
Designing Hardware for Raspberry Pi Projects,https://www.coursera.org/learn/designing-hardware-for-raspberry-pi-projects,Physical Science and Engineering,Electrical Engineering,Drew Wilson,"This is course 4 of this specialization (although it can be taken out of order) and focuses on applying experience and knowledge gained in the first three courses to build physical electronics hardware. Specifically, this course focuses on four areas: circuit simulation, schematic entry, PCB layout, and 3D CAD modeling. There are many excellent commercial applications available in these areas, however to give everyone access we'll be using all free and open-source software.

By the end of this course you should feel comfortable using free and open-source software to design your own printed circuit board and any bracketry or case to hold it, customized for your application.

Module 1 covers circuit simulation using several open-source projects and simulation methods for simulating transient response of circuits as well as frequency-domain response of filters. Additionally, we'll use open-source filter synthesis tools to help you quickly design and simulation filters.

Module 2 is all about creating professional looking electrical schematics. This is both an art and a skill and we'll cover the technical elements of using schematic entry software as well as broad concepts that are portable to any commercial application.

Module 3 takes our schematic and turns it into a physical PCB design. Understanding this process of how the schematic and the PCB layout work together is critical. We'll be demonstrating this with open-source software, but again, the concepts apply to any commercial software you may have access to.

Module 4 demonstrates the powerful idea of co-designing your electrical and mechanical systems together. We'll create a 3D model of our electrical PCB and bring it into 3D CAD software to design mechanical parts around it. Tying together these two applications opens another dimension in customizing your projects.",,10315.0,,
Developments of structural dynamics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/developments-of-structural-dynamics,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Yves Gourinat,"This course is devoted to the dynamic implementation of continuous structural elements vs discrete models.

The prototype of the continuous element being the prismatic beam - as an illustration, but with general value - and the implicit model/solution leads to the major place of natural eigenshapes in vibration and shocks theory and general dynamic representation of structures and foundations of the dynamic tests and certification.
In fact, this course is a perspective on the double vision of any dynamic structure, with the continuous point of view and a digital model in perspective.

At the end of this course, the physicist, the mechanical engineer, the specialist in control will have a general overview of the dynamic representation and implicit solution applicable in structural analysis and control of general dynamic systems.

 In a certain way, it is founded on the famous discussions between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.

Wan, Siddharth A. Parameswaran","Before the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, most scientists believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts. For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.

However, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.

This course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.

This course teaches you everything you need to know about energy, the environment, and at least a number of things in everyday life. It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means. The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.

After explaining the main things we use energy for – our cars and electronics! – fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You’ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.

Finally, nuclear power is taught in detail – how it really works and what happens when it doesn’t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user’s wallet.

"Ethics, Technology and Engineering",https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethics-technology-engineering,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,Lambèr Royakkers,"There is an increasing attention to ethics in engineering practice. Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have “an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” and should ""understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.” 

This course provides an introduction to ethics in engineering and technology. It helps engineers and students in engineering to acquire the competences mentioned in the ABET criteria or comparable criteria formulated in other countries. More specifically, this course helps engineers to acquire the following moral competencies:

- Moral sensibility: the ability to recognize social and ethical issues in engineering;
- Moral analysis skills: the ability to analyse moral problems in terms of facts, values, stakeholders and their interests;
- Moral creativity: the ability to think out different options for action in the light of (conflicting) moral values and the relevant facts;
- Moral judgement skills: the ability to give a moral judgement on the basis of different ethical theories or frameworks including professional ethics and common sense morality;
- Moral decision-making skills: the ability to reflect on different ethical theories and frameworks and to make a decision based on that reflection.

With respect to these competencies, our focus is on the concrete moral problems that engineers encounter in their professional practice. With the help of concrete cases is shown how the decision to develop a technology, as well as the process of design and production, is inherently moral. The attention of the learners is drawn towards the specific moral choices that engineers face. In relation to these concrete choices learners will encounter different reasons for and against certain actions, and they will discover that these reasons can be discussed. In this way, learners become aware of the moral dimensions of technology and acquire the argumentative capacities that are needed in moral debates with stakeholders (e.g. governments, users, and commercial business departments).",21521.0,108430.0,4.7,621.0

General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature.[2] It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.

The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton.[3][4][5] It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age.

Flight mechanics - The basis,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basis-flight-mechanics,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Eric Poquillon,"More than one century after the Wright brothers' first flight, the flight still defy our intuition. You will learn here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry. For that, we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplane's movement and attitude in space, and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles. You will remind how Newton's 2nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple - or on an airplane, to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed. Coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy, you will discover the very useful concept of total height and you will be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude, while changes in total height are much slower. 

In the end, you will discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that you will be able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory. You will discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight nine-time greater than his actual weight! Finally, we will establish the lift and propulsion equations, that form the basis of flight mechanics, and you will be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed.

This course is for anybody interested in learning more about how planes work, the physics of flying, or flight mechanics. It will be of particular interest to undergraduate students in aerospace engineering, trainees as well as senior pilots, journalists, and professionals in the aeronautics sector.

Although some mathematical formalism may be present sometimes. It is always doubled by sketches, figures, and hands-explanations. So that, anybody can skip the formulas without losing the core understanding of the concepts.

This may sound like a fictional adventure movie plot, but from September 2019 through October 2020, the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) Arctic research expedition did just this. 

In this course, you’ll hear directly from MOSAiC scientists and Arctic experts as they describe why this expedition is so key for increasing our understanding of the Arctic and global climate systems and what kinds of data they will be collecting during MOSAiC on the ice, under the sea, and in the air. The course kicks off with content around Arctic geography, climate, and exploration history, and then walks learners through the basics of the components of the Arctic system: atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and ecosystems. You will also learn how the data collected during MOSAiC will be used to improve climate model projections. Finally, we will wrap up the course by exploring challenges the new Arctic faces, including how indigenous peoples in the Arctic are being impacted in different ways by a changing Arctic environment.",3337.0,2802.0,4.8,17.0

Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing,https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital,Physical Science and Engineering,Electrical Engineering,Aggelos K. Katsaggelos,"In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.

Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. 

This course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.

In this view, the meaning of temperature, thermodynamic pressure and chemical potential are especially clear and easy to understand. In addition , the development of the Fundamental Relation and its various transformations leads to a clear path to property relations and to the concept of ensembles needed to understand the relationship between atomic and molecular structural properties and macroscopic properties.  We then explore the relationship between atomic and molecular structure and macroscopic properties by taking a statistical point of view. Using a postulatory approach, the method for doing this is made clear.

A few examples are accelerators for radiotherapy which are the largest application of accelerators, altogether with more than 11000 accelerators worldwide. These accelerators range from very compact electron linear accelerators with a length of only about 1 m to large carbon ion synchrotrons with a circumference of more than 50 m and a huge rotating carbon ion gantry with a weight of 600 tons! 

There are also a growing number of synchrotron light sources in the world. The light in these sources are created by electrons that are accelerated to almost the speed of light. This light can reveal the molecular structures of materials and also take x-ray pictures of the inner structure of objects. Synchrotron light sources are very important in life sciences, material sciences and chemistry. Another type of accelerators are used in spallation sources, like the European Spallation Source in Lund, Sweden. Here protons are accelerated to very large energies. They produce neutrons when they are smashed into a disc of tungsten. These neutrons are used for finding the inner structure of objects and atomic structures of materials. Finally there are many accelerators for basic physics, like the large hadron collider in Cern.

This course takes you on a journey through the technologies used in particle accelerators: The microwave system which produce the electromagnetic waves that accelerate particles; The magnet technology for the magnets that guide and focus the beam of particles;  The monitoring systems that determine the quality of the beam of particles; Finally the vacuum systems that create ultra high vacuum so that the accelerated particles do not collide with molecules and atoms. Exciting right!

The course is graded through quizzes, one for each of the four modules. Throughout the course there are also a number of training quizzes to offer you support. The four modules in the course are: RF-systems, Magnet technology, Beam diagnostics, and Vacuum techniques. In total there are 48 lectures, where each lecture is a 2-4 minutes long video presentation. Some of the lectures are followed by short texts with complementary information and all will hopefully be an exciting collection for you to engage with.

General Chemistry: Concept Development and Application,https://www.coursera.org/learn/general-chemistry,Physical Science and Engineering,Chemistry,John Steven Hutchinson,"This course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. 

The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.

So why use this approach? 

One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. 

A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  

A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

Recommended Background: 
The class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.

Suggested Readings:
Readings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, ""Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition"".

Cost is usually a big one, but sometimes there are other factors that are the main contributors to a product's direction. With vehicles, specifically motorcycles, we see advanced engineering practices performed on seemingly minor parts. In some instances, making a part as light as possible can have a big effect on performance. In other cases, the strength or stiffness of a part, such as a motor mount, is more critical than its mass. Generative design allows us the ability to solve for both problems at the same time and make informed design decisions without the sacrifice.

Geographical Information Systems - Part 1,https://www.coursera.org/learn/gis-1,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Stéphane Joost, Marc Soutter , Fernand Koffi Kouamé, Amadou Sall","This course is organized into two parts presenting the theoretical and practical foundations of geographic information systems (GIS).

- Together theses courses constitute an introduction to GIS and require no prior knowledge.
- By following this introduction to GIS you will quickly acquire the basic knowledge required to create spatial databases and produce high-quality maps and cartographic representations.
- This is a practical course and is based on free, open-source software, including QGIS.
If you study or work in the fields of land management or the analysis of geographically distributed objects such as land use planning, biology, public health, ecology, or energy, then this course is for you!

In this first part of the course, we will focus on the digitization and the storage of geodata. In particular, you will learn:
- To characterize spatial objects and/or phenomena (territory modeling) with respect to their position in space (through coordinate systems, projections, and spatial relationships) and according to their intrinsic nature (object/vector mode vs. Image/raster mode); 
- About the different means used to acquire spatial data; including direct measurement, georeferencing images, digitization, existing data source, etc.);
- About the different ways in which geodata can be stored - notably, files and relational databases;
- How to use data modeling tools to describe and create a spatial database;
- To query and analyze data using SQL, a common data manipulation language.

The second part of this course will focus on methods of spatial analysis and geodata representation. In this section, you will learn:
- How to describe and quantify the spatial properties of discrete variables, for example through spatial autocorrelation;
- To work with continuous variables. In particular, we will look at sampling strategies, how to construct contour lines and isovalue curves, and we will explore different interpolation methods;
- To use digital elevation models and create their derivative products (i.e. slope, orientation);
- How to evaluate the interaction between different types of geodata through overlay and interaction techniques;
- How to create effective maps based around the rules of graphic semiology;

It offers an introduction to GIS that does not require prior computer skills. It gives the opportunity to quickly acquire the basics that allow you to create spatial databases and produce geographic maps.
This is a practical course that relies on the use of free Open Source software (QGIS, Geoda).

In the first part of the course (Geographical Information Systems - Part 1), you explored the basics of land digitization and geodata storage. In particular, you learned how to:
- Characterize spatial objects and phenomena (spatial modeling) from the point of view of their positioning in space (coordinate systems and projections, spatial relationships) and according to their intrinsic nature (object or vector mode vs. image or raster mode);
- Use various data acquisition methods (direct measurement, georeferencing of images, digitization, existing data source, etc.);
- Use various geodata storage methods (simple files and relational databases);
- Use data modeling tools to describe and implement a database;
- Create queries in a query language and data manipulation.

The second part of the course deals with spatial analysis methods and georeferenced information representation techniques. In particular, you will learn how to:
- Analyze the spatial properties of discrete variables, for example by quantifying spatial autocorrelation;
- Work with continuous variables (sampling, interpolation and construction of isolines)
- Use digital elevation models (DEMs) and their derivatives (slope, orientation, etc.);
- Use geodata superposition techniques;
- Produce cartographic documents according to the rules of the semiology of graphics;
- Explore other forms of spatial representation (interactive cartography on the internet, 3D representations, and augmented reality).

Introduction to Particle Accelerators (NPAP MOOC),https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-particle-accelerators,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,"Sverker Werin, Francesca Curbis, Mats Lindroos, Erik Adli","Welcome to the Nordic Particle Accelerator Program's (NPAP) Massive Open Online Courses and to the fascinating world of particle accelerators!

Did you know that in the year of 2000 there were more than 15 000 particle accelerators in the world? Yet, today it has grown to more than 30 000 of them! A third of the particle accelerators are dedicated to medical applications, such as radio therapy, and a half are used for ion implantation in semiconductor devices. Also numerous particle accelerators are used for sterilizing food. Despite these everyday life examples of small particle accelerators, it is the large accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, that most people associate with particle accelerators. There will be many new applications for particle accelerators in the future and by that there is a need for MOOCs that describe the techniques and applications of these machines..

The NPAP series of MOOCs consists of three MOOCs designed to disseminate knowledge about particle accelerator technology to impacted fields. The courses have been made possible thanks to the support of the Erasmus Plus, Strategic Partnership funding of the European Commission and thanks to the dedicated lecturers from the universities of Lund, Uppsala, Arhus, Oslo and Jyväskylä, and by experts from the MAX IV Laboratory and European Spallation Source (ESS), both in Lund, Sweden. 

In many of the lectures we detail the MAX IV Laboratory and ESS - currently hosting the most powerful synchrotron light source and neutron source in the world.  In the MAX IV Laboratory intense X-ray beams are produced by electrons that are first accelerated to almost the speed of light, and at ESS protons will be accelerated and, by a process called spallation, generate intense beams of neutron. The X-ray and neutron beams are used for looking into matter, down to the atomic level. The MAX IV Laboratory and ESS form a unique European center of excellence for thousands of scientists that together build the world of tomorrow. We also take a closer look at the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN, in Geneva. This powerful machine has already had an immense impact on theoretical physics and will continue to contribute to our knowledge of nature for quite some time. 

The first course in our NPAP series is the Introduction to Particle Accelerators. It explains how a particle accelerator can  generate light of wavelengths down to one Angstrom. It also explains how the ESS facility can create a massive flux of neutrons by accelerating protons and let them smash  into a disk of tungsten. The initial modules provide the basic knowledge about linear and circular accelerators that is required to understand other types of accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva. We describe LHC and give an introduction to the elementary particle physics it is used for. We continue by describing some new concepts for future particle accelerators, like  plasma driven accelerators.

The second MOOC in the series is called ""Fundamentals of Particle Accelerator Technology (NPAP MOOC)"" and offers four modules: The Radio Frequency (RF) System of Accelerators; Magnet technology for accelerator;  Beam Diagnostics; Basics of Vacuum techniques.  The third MOOC is - Medical Applications of Particle Accelerators, which offers the four modules: Introduction to the course and radiotherapy;  Linear electron accelerators for radiotherapy; Proton therapy part I; Proton therapy part  II and the production of medical radionuclides.

The three MOOCs can be taken either separately or as a package. For students that intend to take all three courses we recommend that they are taken in order.  

Get started and join us on this journey through the world of particle accelerators and be amazed by their importance for our lives and societies!

It can be studied under main two topics which are kinematics concerning the motion of the particle and dynamics concerning the causes of motion. Kinematics is one of the two branches of mechanics. It deals with the motion of particles not the causes of the motion. Motion in one dimension in other words linear motion and projectile motion are the subtitles of kinematics they are also called as 1D and 2D kinematics. Dynamics deal with the causes of motion.

Mycelium Growth with NetLogo Web,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mycelium,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Danilo Oliveira Vaz,"Underneath our feet, spreading across the globe, a magnificent being resides. As a living network, it breaks down compounds from minerals and dead plants and animals in the soil (and pollutants as well), only to distribute these nutrients to other living organisms. Therefore, providing the cyclical nature characteristic of Nature. When conditions are right, some of these organisms will fruit into beautiful mushrooms, some of which are incredibly nutritious and with miraculous medicinal properties. The organism described is the Mycelium, or the vegetative part of a fungus organism.

In this project we will create an agent based model that simulates possible mechanisms through which fungi mycelium grows, as observed through microscopic lenses. For that we will be working with NetLogo Web, a very powerful online modeling environment. Learns will be introduced to this environment, as well as the basics of the Logo programming language.

Esta reputación, bastante inmerecida, obedece al poco conocimiento que se tiene sobre ella y sobre sus enormes posibilidades de aplicación en el mundo científico, en diferentes campos de la industria y la producción, así como en la vida cotidiana. Así, si se observa con atención el mundo, es posible identificar un sinnúmero de aplicaciones de la química, que hacen la vida más cómoda: éstas van por ejemplo desde la producción de alimentos y la generación de nuevos medicamentos, hasta la producción de nuevos materiales, de gran importancia para misiones espaciales. 

En este curso, distribuido en 5 módulos, se pretende aproximar al estudiante al maravilloso mundo de la Química. Cada módulo está orientado a trabajar con fundamentos o conceptos básicos de la Química, a través de cuyo estudio se posibilita su mejor comprensión y manejo. Así, el primer módulo versa sobre las medidas y cifras significativas; con él, se aprenderá acerca de la importancia de la medición en la labor del químico. En el segundo módulo se aborda el tema de los factores de conversión, necesarios para los procesos llevados a cabo en el laboratorio. En el tercero, es posible conocer la tabla periódica, su nomenclatura y sus elementos.  El cuarto módulo se centra en el trabajo alrededor del concepto de mol y en fórmulas químicas, útiles para comprender las relaciones estequiométricas. Por último, en el quinto módulo se trabaja el tema de las reacciones químicas y la estequiometría, fundamentales para el trabajo no solo del químico, sino del biólogo, el farmaceuta y el ingeniero de alimentos.

The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied.  Despite these advances, restoring groundwater contaminated by anthropogenic sources to allow for unrestricted use continues to be a challenge. Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes.

We will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes.  Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology.

Planet Earth...and You!,https://www.coursera.org/learn/planet-earth,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Dr. Stephen Marshak, Dr. Eileen Herrstrom","Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motions—all of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today.  Planet Earth presents an overview of several aspects of our home, from a geological perspective.  We begin with earthquakes—what they are, what causes them, what effects they have, and what we can do about them. We will emphasize that plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters such as earthquakes—occur where they do.  We consider volcanoes, types of eruptions, and typical rocks found there. Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.",24337.0,19182.0,4.9,510.0

Planning for Climate Change in African Cities,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-change-africa,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Veronica Olivotto, Dr. Shuaib Lwasa , Prof. Andy Gouldson, Marcus Mayr, Dr. Stelios Grafakos, Dr. David Dodman, Dr. Diana Reckien, Dr. Nathalie Jean Baptiste","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   

Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? 

Course Objectives:
At the end of this course, learners should be able to:

•	Recognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities
•	Understand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change 
•	Distinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation 
•	Explain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning 
•	Examine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change
•	Develop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts",9048.0,7235.0,4.8,110.0

Plant Bioinformatics Capstone,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics-capstone,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,Nicholas James Provart,"The past 15 years have been exciting ones in plant biology. Hundreds of plant genomes have been sequenced, RNA-seq has enabled transcriptome-wide expression profiling, and a proliferation of ""-seq""-based methods has permitted protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to be determined cheaply and in a high-throughput manner. These data sets in turn allow us to generate hypotheses at the click of a mouse or tap of a finger.

In Plant Bioinformatics on Coursera.org, we covered 33 plant-specific online tools from genome browsers to transcriptomic data mining to promoter/network analyses and others, and in this Plant Bioinformatics Capstone we'll use these tools to hypothesize a biological role for a gene of unknown function, summarized in a written lab report.

This course is part of a Plant Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera, which introduces core bioinformatic competencies and resources, such as NCBI's Genbank, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics in Bioinformatic Methods I, followed by protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis in Bioinformatic Methods II, in addition to the plant-specific concepts and tools introduced in Plant Bioinformatics and the Plant Bioinformatics Capstone.

Silicon Thin Film Solar Cells,https://www.coursera.org/learn/silicon-thin-film-solar-cells,Physical Science and Engineering,Electrical Engineering,"Pr. Bernard Drevillon, Erik Johnson","This course consists of a general presentation of solar cells based on silicon thin films. 

It is the third MOOC of the photovoltaic series of Ecole polytechnique on Coursera. The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in ""Photovoltaic Solar Energy"". And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in ""Physics of Silicon Solar Cells"".

After a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 µm thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.

The consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.

Finally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).

Simulation Analysis for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360,https://www.coursera.org/learn/simulation-analysis-mechanical-engineers,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Autodesk,"The foundation of engineering design is often coupled with validation. Simulation is a great tool that allows engineers to test, validate, and modify designs before they become a physical prototype. When used early in the process for simulation driven design and throughout the development process, simulation can help drive the design, make informed design decisions, speed up time to production, and most importantly, identify and eliminate costly design mistakes.  

Like any other tool though, it must be used properly to yield the best results. In this course, we’ll explore the usage static stress simulation, shape optimization, thermal and other mechanical simulation types to better understand how we can apply these tools to everyday design problems.

After taking this course, you'll be able to:

- Describe the simulation workflow in Fusion 360.
- Summarize the use cases for various types of simulation studies.
- Demonstrate knowledge and skills in more advanced Fusion 360 CAD and CAE skills.
- Explain and identify simulation results

Sistemas agrosilvopastoriles: una alternativa climáticamente inteligente para la ganadería,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sistemas-agrosilvopastoriles,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,María Elena Martínez Murillo Cuervo ,"El mundo enfrenta hoy el titánico reto de alimentar a una población creciente en un contexto de cambio climático y con mayores presiones sobre los ecosistemas naturales. En particular, las proyecciones indican que el consumo de carne a nivel mundial se duplicará en los próximos 20 años por el incremento de la población, del ingreso y por cambios en los patrones de consumo. La demanda para carne de calidad seguirá incrementando a una tasa del 5% anual en países en desarrollo durante las próximas cuatro décadas con lo cual la presión sobre los bosques no desaparecerá.

A la par, el desarrollo de la ganadería representa una fuente de alimento y recursos económicos para miles de familias rurales. En números llanos, una tercera parte de la población mundial depende de la agricultura para su supervivencia y el 60% de los agricultores también son ganaderos. La ganadería proporciona ingresos y alimento a mil millones de personas pobres y para muchos campesinos en condición de pobreza, el ganado es una fuente de energía como fuerza de tiro, un medio de transporte, una fuente esencial de fertilizante orgánico para cultivos agrícolas, provee subproductos como la lana y el cuero, y funge como un mecanismo de ahorro y capital en momentos de necesidad económica, por ejemplo mediante la venta o el intercambio de un animal en caso de ser necesario. 

En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, se abordan los beneficios y retos de la ganadería y la necesidad de transitar hacia nuevos esquemas de producción más amigable con el ambiente. Asimismo, profundiza en los sistemas agrosilvopastoriles como alternativas productivas sociales y ambientalmente viables, así como rentables que no sólo repercuten en el bienestar a nivel local sino que contribuyen al cumplimiento de metas globales de desarrollo sostenible.

Spacecraft Dynamics Capstone: Mars Mission,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Hanspeter Schaub,"The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. 

Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.

Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  

Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.

Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.",4259.0,1501.0,4.7,40.0

This is Course #2 in the Modeling and Control of Power Electronics course sequence. The course is focused on techniques of design-oriented analysis that allow you to quickly gain insights into models of switching power converters and to translate these insights into practical converter designs. The design-oriented techniques covered are the Extra Element Theorem and the N-Extra Element Theorem (N-EET). Through practical examples, it is shown how the EET can be used to simplify circuit analysis, to examine the effects of initially unmodeled components, and to design damping of converters such as SEPIC and Cuk to achieve high-performance closed-loop controls. The N-EET will allow you to perform circuit analysis and to derive circuit responses with minimum algebra. Modeling and design examples are supported by design-oriented MATLAB script and Spice simulations. After completion of this course, the student will gain analytical skills applicable to the design of high-performance closed-loop controlled switching power converters. 

We strongly recommend students complete the CU Boulder Power Electronics specialization as well as Course #1 Averaged-Switch Modeling and Simulation before enrolling in this course (the course numbers provided below are for students in the CU Boulder's MS-EE program):

● Understand statement and derivation of the Extra Element Theorem
● Apply the Extra Element Theorem to converter analysis and design problems
● Understand the statement of the N-Extra Element Theorem
● Apply the N-Extra Element Theorem to converter analysis and design problems
● Apply techniques of design-oriented analysis to analysis, design, and simulations of switching converters",2190.0,7342.0,4.8,20.0

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/finite-element-method,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,"Krishna Garikipati, Ph.D.","This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.

The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an
introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is
natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not
formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a
competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional
analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the
methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite
Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical
foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner
presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,
although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.

The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):
elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to
the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in
one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We
then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and
mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems
in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next
(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in
three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to
questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who
followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical
development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.

There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required
textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader

The Sun and the Total Eclipse of August 2017,https://www.coursera.org/learn/eclipse,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Douglas Duncan,"A total eclipse is one of the most spectacular sights you can ever see!  It looks like the end of the world may be at hand. There is a black hole in the sky where the sun should be. Pink flames of solar prominences and long silver streamers of the sun's corona stretch across the sky. It gets cold, and animals do strange things. People scream and shout and cheer, and remember the experience their whole life.  But total eclipses are important scientifically as well. They let us see parts of the sun’s atmosphere that are otherwise invisible. A total eclipse presented the first chance to test Einstein’s prediction that matter can bend space – like near a black hole. The best total eclipse in the United States in 40 years happens August 21st, 2017.  

This course has two primary goals: 

1) to get you excited for the total solar eclipse coming in August 2017 and prepare you and your community to safely view it 
2) to provide an inviting overview of the science of the sun and the physics of light

If you are most interested in preparing for the eclipse, you can hop right into Week 5! If you want the full course experience, and to get some fun scientific context for what you'll be seeing on August 21st, start with Week 1 and move through the course week by week!

[Note: if you start with Week 1, you can skip through some of the repeated material once you get to Week 5.]

Overall this course will prepare you to... 

* Safely view the total or partial solar eclipse
* Help others watch safely and even make money by leading a “neighborhood watch” of the eclipse
* Review fundamental sun science, including the physics of light, how astronomers study the sun, how it formed, how we know what’s inside it, and where the energy that supports life on earth is generated",5137.0,,4.7,66.0

Transformation of the Global Food System,https://www.coursera.org/learn/transformation-global-food-system,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Katherine Richardson,"The UN predicts we will be 9-10 billion people on Earth in 2050. Providing so many people with nutritious foods is a massive challenge and one that cannot be met by simply upscaling current practices regarding food production and consumption. Providing humanity with nutritional food is at the center of all decisions related to sustainable development.

Agriculture is responsible for 80% of global deforestation. The food systems release 29% of global greenhouse gasses. We use an area equivalent to North and South America combined for the production of meat for consumption or to produce the food necessary to feed the animals we eat. 70% of fresh water use is related to agriculture. These figures are staggering, and they show us, that we need to rethink and transform the way we produce, distribute and consume food worldwide.

This course focuses on how food systems can become more sustainable. It consists of four modules where each focuses on an essential ingredient towards developing more sustainable food systems: (1) Boosting the small, (2) Transforming the big, (3) Losing less and (4) Eating smarter. In each of these key areas, we will meet people from different countries around the world, who labor every day to find and spread solutions that work.

Connecting the challenges that must be overcome to develop a sustainable global food system with the solutions being developed by the amazing group of people you meet in this course has been a huge source of inspiration for me.

For an instrument operated by a single user, modern TEM provides an analytical platform with unsurpassed versatility, giving access to structural and chemical information from the micrometer to the sub-angstrom scale. In a thin, electron-transparent sample one can measure the crystallinity, grain structure, size, and defects, and the chemical composition. The crystal lattice can be imaged with atomic resolution, allowing observation of grain boundaries and interfaces. It is the only direct structural analysis method for studying nanoparticles.
 
With this course you will gain a deep understanding of modern TEM and the connection between: 
-	the optics and operation of the instrument; 
-	the physics of electron-matter interactions; 
-	insights into the materials properties of the sample. 

This gives the background to: 
-	identify TEM techniques suitable to solving specific scientific problems; 
-	interpret TEM data presented in articles; appreciate the impact of technological advances that have, for instance, led to sub-angstrom resolution by aberration correction. 
It can also be the basis for subsequent practical training on this remarkable instrument, and a stepping stone towards  learning very advanced techniques with magical names like “dark field holography” or  “angular resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy”. 

Recommended background: 

Basics of crystallography and diffraction, college optics (construction of ray diagrams) are absolutely mandatory prerequisites; Fourier optics, more advanced crystallography and solid state physics are of great advantage.",11718.0,21468.0,4.6,99.0

Uncertainty and Research,https://www.coursera.org/learn/uncertainty-and-research,Physical Science and Engineering,Research Methods,Michael Shields,"This course teaches the fundamentals of scientific research. We approach the research process as a means of systematically reducing uncertainty and demonstrate how conducting a scientific investigation can be posed as an exercise in Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We begin by exploring the scientific landscape to understand the different types of research, where they are conducted, how they are supported, and why each of these types of research is important. We then formalize scientific inquiry and the scientific method and elaborate the research process and its scientific merits. Basic concepts in probability theory are introduced leading to a conceptually simple presentation of Bayes’ Rule. We then illustrate how Bayes’ Rule provides a mathematical framework for the research process. We place an emphasis on the role that research plays in our daily and professional lives and how research skills can help us think critically, whether you’re in a technical field or not. Exercises are designed to help you improve your research skills and think more scientifically. 

Learners who are new to research fields or would like to improve their research skills in any field for career/professional or personal growth are encouraged to enroll.

Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity,https://www.coursera.org/learn/einstein-relativity,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Larry Randles Lagerstrom,"In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a twenty-six year old patent clerk, introduced in his “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?

Wood Science: Beyond Building,https://www.coursera.org/learn/wood-science,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Lawrence Osborn, Jeffrey Slahor","The central question of this course: “why study wood?” If “why study wood” is the question, one answer would be that it is the only raw material available to us that is truly renewable in human life span terms. Wood is as important to society today as it ever was, despite the development of many man-made substitute materials, changing resource availability, and the changing needs of society.  Some items on the list of wood products stay the same (lumber, plywood and veneer for building construction, furniture, shipping pallets & crates and other containers & packaging materials, railroad ties, utility poles, chemical feed stocks, etc), but the list also keeps changing to meet new needs and challenges as the resource changes.

In short, wood is a far more diverse, green, and renewable resource than you might have imagined. Join us to learn about the important role of wood in human history, civilization, and our future.

By the end of the course, learners will be able to:
- describe wood as a raw material and its critical importance to the world economy, and the lives of the people that make that economy work.  
- identify the projected trend for wood consumption to continue to grow in the coming years, despite the image of wood as a ""low tech"" material.  
- identify the ways in which wood's properties can lead to its efficient and sustainable use.
-identify wood's positive role in boosting the world economy and ability to lead to unexpected vocations.",18378.0,9437.0,4.6,693.0
Working for a sustainable future: concepts and approaches,https://www.coursera.org/learn/working-for-a-sustainable-future,Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,"Mine Islar, Juan Ocampo, Cristina Chaminade, Helen Avery, Henner Busch, Dr. Yuliya Voytenko Palgan, Dr. Paul Graham Raven, MA, Philip Peck, Ali Mansourian, Jean-Nicolas Poussart, Markku Rummukainen","In this course, participants are introduced to key notions and concepts evolving in sustainability science that are relevant to all, independent to one's work or field of interest. After having completed the course, participants will have a better understanding of the vocabulary used today and should demonstrate the ability to reflect critically to integrate different perspectives of environmental, social, and economic sustainability to their specific area of interest or research. 

Throughout the course, links are made to the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, as our current global road map towards sustainability, and how new approaches and solutions are emerging to describe, understand and address key sustainability challenges. Put simply, the overall aim is to give participants the knowledge and confidence needed to present and discuss ideas with others by applying methods, concepts and the vocabulary exemplified in the course with a more holistic view on the sustainability agenda across topics and disciplines.

The course is designed as 5 modules:

The first module presents essential concepts within sustainability science, and methods used to describe, frame, and communicate aspects of sustainability. We look at key questions such as what we mean with strong or weak sustainability, resilience, tipping points and the notion of planetary boundaries. We also look at some techniques used of envisioning alternative futures and transitions pathways.

The second module is all about systems thinking and how systemic approaches are applied today to achieve long-term sustainability goals. Your will see what we mean with systems thinking and how systems thinking, and design is applied in practice to find new solutions.
 
The third module touches upon drivers for a sustainable future, namely links to economy and business with an introduction to notions of a circular economy, and also policy and regulatory frameworks. We introduce the basics of transformative policy frames and how they are designed and applied through several real-case examples.

The fourth module discusses the links between innovation and sustainability, highlighting approaches for technological, social, institutional, and financial innovations. Some examples (or cases) aim to show how different actors across society balance in practice the need for innovative approaches for social, environmental, and economic sustainability.

The fifth and last module provides general insights on how we work with models to create various scenarios that help us identify solutions and pathways for a more sustainable world. Three main dimensions are addressed namely climate and climate change, nature and biodiversity, and the importance of data and geodata science to support spatial planning and sustainable land use.

材料力學一 (Mechanics of Materials (1)),https://www.coursera.org/learn/mechanics-of-materials-1,Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,黃尹男,"課程介紹與教學目標 (About the course)

房屋為我們遮風避雨，讓我們安心工作、生活，而結構系統又是房屋的骨幹，讓房屋能站的又高、又直、又穩。你知道橫者為梁，直者為柱，但你知道在結構工程師的眼中，梁與柱有什麼其他的不同嗎？他們其中藏著什麼秘密，能支撐起整個結構？工程師要怎麼決定梁該有多深？柱該有多粗？該用矩形、圓形還是其他形狀？該用實心還是空心？在有地震的地方，設計上是否又有不一樣的考量？
　　材料力學是通往上述問題解答關鍵的一步。在材料力學(一)裡，我們會由大家熟知的虎克定律開始，以蓋房子的重要材料「結構鋼」為例，深入探討「力量」與「變形」這兩個令結構工程師愛恨交加的物理量之間的關係。然後依序探討結構桿件受軸力（拉/壓）、受扭、受彎、受剪四大外力作用下，會在桿件內部產生怎樣的相對應變形與受力，並探討建築結構設計概念與提供桿件設計演算範例。
　　本課程是希望精通「鋼筋混凝土設計」、「鋼結構設計」、「木構造設計」者必備的先修課程，也為對「彈性力學」有興趣者，提供許多基礎知識與這些知識如何實際應用於工程設計。
主要授課對象為土木、建築相關從業人員與在學學生，其他包括工學院各科系同學或對材料力學有興趣的人士，也歡迎選修。

电磁学上——恒定电场,https://www.coursera.org/learn/dianci,Physical Science and Engineering,Physics and Astronomy,Ms 王稼军   WangJiaJun,"电磁学是普通物理系列中最重要的基础课之一，是高等学校每一个理工科学生必修课程，本课程包括静电场、恒磁场、电磁感应、电磁介质、电路、麦克斯韦电磁场理论、电磁波等内容，首次系统地向学生介绍“场”的概念和处理“场”的方法，对学生今后学习和工作有深远的影响。本课程作为中国大学先修课（AP课程）向有志于学习物理及相关专业的学有余力的优秀中学生开放，培养学科兴趣，提高科学素养，打下扎实的物理基础。

2014年9月以来《电磁学》已经两度上线开课，教学内容是按周上载，共有十三周课程。考虑到很多大学生和中学生不一定有条件按照我们原来按周上载课件的节奏学习，有的同学反映开始拉下了进度，后面就跟不上了，练习也是有时限的，过了时限就没法记录练习的成绩了。因此我们团队决定将原来上线的《电磁学》课程拆分成两个学习进程在on demand上线，在on demand上，我们将所有课程内容全部上载，没有教学时限，由学生自行安排学习时间和进度，自己完成课后练习，以便随时为需要的学生提供学习的资料和练习。练习题可以多次尝试，只是必须做对每个模块练习题的80%，才可以通过。又考虑到《电磁学》内容比较多，因此将原来十三周的教学内容分成两个学习阶段。《电磁学上》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的前三章即静电场、导体和电介质以及直流电。这三部分内容属于恒定电场范畴，这些内容应该是深入学习电磁学的基础，在这部分课程结尾，设置了一个结业考试，相当于大学课程的期中考试。第二个学习进程《电磁学下》包含的内容是《大学物理通用教程》电磁学的后五章即恒磁场、磁介质，电磁感应、交流电和电磁场电磁波。建议大家学习了第一进程，通过了结业考试以后再进入第二学习进程《电磁学下》的学习。
        本课程的课程是按照知识点设置模块，《电磁学上》包含5个模块，《电磁学下》包含6个模块。每个模块又包含几节课，每个模块结束有一个小测，同学们可以自我测试，没有时间限制，大家可以根据自己的需要和时间安排来自主学习，以免一步跟不上，步步跟不上，这对于学习我们这种理论性比较强的课是有利的，已经明白的可以跳过去，不清楚的可以重点学习。
