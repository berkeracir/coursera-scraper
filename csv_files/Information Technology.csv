Tables are great for data storage. The concept of organizing data in rows and columns is familiar to most people. Accountants use spreadsheets to organize financial data, making it easier to budget and track expenses. Parents use lists with columns to track their family’s schedules so that everyone gets to participate in outside activities. Even the Internal Revenue Service gets in the game by using tax tables to provide tax amounts for a variety of incomes. Even a simple grocery list is tabular in nature. Each row is an item, with one column having the item's name/description, and a second column noting the quantity needed. It’s no surprise that database designers like to use tables in a relational database to organize and store data. In the Design and Create a Relational Database Table Using SQLiteStudio course you learned about tables.

Automate Approval Process with SharePoint & Power Automate,https://www.coursera.org/learn/automate-approval-process-sharepoint-power-automate,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Imagine working in a car rental company that has a manual system for keeping track of the cars that are currently rented out. Can you imagine all that paperwork and having to chase your manager across the office to approve each car rental request? Thankfully, with technology we can put many manual processes under control and automate almost everything.

This intermediate-level guided project, “Automate Approval Process with SharePoint & Power Automate” is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of a business approval process and has some prior knowledge of Excel formulas.

In this Intermediate-level guided project, you will create a SharePoint site and lists, and use Power Automate to automate approval process for car rental requests by employees. You will also make a calendar which will show when the cars are rented out, and you will learn to create flows that send reminders to the managers. What’s great about SharePoint and Power Automate is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background!

Since this project uses Power Automate (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both, as well as how to set up SharePoint. The SharePoint set up might take up to 2 hours to complete, so please take that into account.

Automate Doc Review Process with SharePoint & Power Automate,https://www.coursera.org/learn/automate-document-review-process-sharepoint-power-automate,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Every company must create various documents or reports and show them to responsible colleagues, mostly their supervisors, so they can approve or reject the document. Employees spend a lot of time chasing those responsible colleagues all over the company or sending them multiple emails to remind them about the documents waiting to be checked. 

For example, a junior business analyst creates a business offer document and of course, it needs to be reviewed and approved by a senior business analyst, a CEO, or another superior. You can imagine how exhausting and time consuming it can be for the employee to find the corresponding colleague and get the wanted feedback on the document, or to send them repetitive emails each morning reminding them about it. Thankfully, we can leverage Power Automate and SharePoint functionalities and automate the whole process after the document is created. An employee will just create the document, upload it to the SharePoint document library and Power Automate will handle the rest automatically. This might be a huge timesaver for the employee since they don’t need to chase colleagues or send them emails anymore.

This Guided Project ""Automate Doc Review Process with SharePoint & Power Automate"" is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of document or report approval.

In this Guided Project, you will learn how to create a SharePoint site, document library and list, and how to use Power Automate to automate the process of sending requests for document approval to the corresponding employees.

At the end of the month, all requests are collected into an HTML table and sent via email to the department in charge of ordering the equipment, and the person who made the request receives an email that their request has been approved and the equipment will be ordered.

First, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend your code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. We'll show you some simple examples of how to perform common tasks in the course material, but it will be up to you to explore the module documentation to figure out how to solve specific problems.

Next, we'll show you how to communicate with the world outside of your code! You'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages.

Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-building-modern-net-applications,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,"Russell Sayers, Seph Robinson, Morgan Willis","In modern cloud native application development, it’s oftentimes the goal to build out serverless architectures that are scalable, are highly available, and are fully managed. This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS. 

Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application. 	`

Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API. 

Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.

Cloud Cost Management: Optimization Strategies,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-cost-management-optimization-strategies,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Morgan Willis,"Cloud cost management is the organizational planning that allows an enterprise to understand and manage the costs and needs associated with its cloud technology. In particular, this means finding cost-effective ways to maximize cloud usage and efficiency. AWS has a set of services, tools and resources to help the customers with cost management and optimization. This course will highlight the solutions and best practices to get started with optimizing AWS cost and capacity.

For effective cost control in cloud computing services, it is quite important to analyze and manage cloud cost and leverage cloud cost management tools to help discover the cause(s) of these inefficiencies. Unplanned cloud costs are frequently the result of lack of visibility about the current consumption patterns and past trends, nonstandard deployments that come from unclear or absent development processes, poor organization, or the absence of automated deployment and configuration tools. By contrast with on-premise infrastructure, which is financed by fixed upfront investments, cloud consumption is an everyday operational expense. This requires a huge shift in your approach to operational management, where optimizing cloud cost is as important as optimizing performance.

A well-defined cost optimization framework helps establish cloud budget, design standards and best practices to follow that budget, and employ cloud solutions that support the organization’s financial goals.",,4172.0,4.6,14.0

Cloud and Wireless Security,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-6,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 6: Cloud and Wireless Security

Welcome to course six. This course applies to security concepts, ideas, and considerations to two major changes that we have experienced in recent years. It's regarding the way we use the data. First, we use our data on the go. In other words, data services are provided to our mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and other devices. Second, many enhanced functions are implemented through services hosted in the cloud platform, where our data is stored or processed. Both transformations are complex topics. However, as a security practitioner, we can narrow these two topics by applying the security fundamentals to secure the data. This boils down to the three basics of protecting data at rest, in motion, and in use. The data is either on the endpoint devices, servers, or other endpoints, making these services a reality. 

Course 6 Learning Objectives

After completing this course, the participant will be able to: 

L6.1 - Recall cloud security concepts and configurations.
L6.2 - Recognize types of virtualization and cloud security considerations.
L6.3 - Summarize the types of telecommunications and network access controls.

Course Agenda

Module 1: Operate and Configure Cloud Security (Domain 7 - Systems and Application Security)

Cognitive Solutions and RPA Analytics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cognitive-solutions-rpa-analytics,Information Technology,Data Management,"Automation Anywhere, Inc.","Millions of companies in the world today are processing endless documents in various formats. Although Robotic Process Automation (RPA) thrives in almost every industry and is growing fast, it works well only with structured data sources.

What about the data that’s not fully structured and comes in varying layouts? To address this problem, there is another aspect of RPA that is taking the industry by storm: cognitive automation. 

While implementing RPA, you can deploy automations with “cognitive” capabilities. Cognitive automation uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn and understand the same way the human brain works. Thus, it assists humans in making decisions, completing tasks, or meeting goals. Using cognitive automation, you can extract semi—or unstructured data—which is 80% of all data!

Data is a precious asset. Businesses struggle to make sense of large volumes of available data and to generate a tangible value from them. Manual business processes barely contain any data that is available for capture. This is where Robotic Process Automation (or RPA) Analytics comes in. RPA bots don’t just automate business processes; they also digitize them. They take the large volume of data and interpret it in near real-time to provide actionable information.

In this course, you will be introduced to cognitive automation, the role that AI plays in it, and Automation Anywhere’s cognitive solution, IQ Bot. You will also be introduced to RPA analytics and explore how Automation Anywhere’s Web Control Room and Bot Insight can provide this functionality. 

As you begin this course, you will learn the six steps to deploy cognitive automation. Next, you will explore the IQ Bot portal – Automation Anywhere’s web-based application for developing the cognitive IQ bots. You will then learn to use the portal by following the IQ Bot workflow. 

Next, you will learn how RPA analytics help interpret and improve automated business processes. You will see how Bot Insight functions as an RPA analytics platform. 

You will also explore the different types of RPA analytics and learn how to generate RPA analytics via two mechanisms – the Web Control Room for Operational Analytics and Bot Insight for Business Analytics and CoE Analytics.

Finally, you will learn how to use the RPA mobile app to study and edit the default CoE dashboard that is published via Bot Insight.",3820.0,1880.0,4.4,26.0

Command Line in Linux,https://www.coursera.org/learn/command-line-linux,Information Technology,Support and Operations,David Dalsveen,"Linux is a popular operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It has many distributions which have different interfaces for installing software, different user interfaces, and so on. One thing all of the ‘distros’ have in common is that they all have a command line interface, or terminal. In fact, sometimes there is no user interface except the terminal itself. A Linux server running a web application on AWS, for example, may only contain the software required to run the application, and no GUI ‘window’ system at all. It is crucial to learn the Linux command line if you are going to be a productive Linux user and/or administer a Linux server.

In this course, you will use Linux commands to navigate Linux directories, search for files, search for patterns, create files and directories, and remove files and directories.

Étant programmeurs de bases de données débutants, vous serez capables de créer des fichiers SQL, de créer des bases de données, de créer des tables pour représenter les relations d’une base de données relationnelle et enfin de manipuler ces données.
A travers ce projet, nous allons renforcer ces notions en créant une base de données complète d'un restaurant comprenant ses employés et les différents plats dans son menu. en plus d'en extraire des aperçus pertinents, tout en utilisant SQL.
SQL comprend plusieurs types de langages. Dans ce projet, nous nous concentrerons sur 3 types de langages : langage de définition de données (DDL), langage de manipulation de données (DML) et langage de requête de données (DQL).
-Le langage de définition de données est utilisé pour définir les structures telles que le schéma, la base de données, les tables, les contraintes, etc. Des exemples sont les instructions de création.
-Le langage de manipulation de données est utilisé pour manipuler des données. Des exemples sont les instructions d'insertion, de mise à jour et de suppression.
- Le langage de requête de données est utilisé pour effectuer des requêtes sur les données dans les objets de schéma. Le but des commandes DQL est d'obtenir la relation de schéma en fonction de la requête qui lui est transmise. Des exemples sont les instructions de sélection.

Ces langages construisent le système de gestion de base de données qui est un logiciel moteur qui manipule la base de données et dirige l'accès à son contenu.

Enfin, vous allez utiliser les fonctions d’agrégation qui permettent de regrouper les valeurs de plusieurs lignes de données selon certains critères pour former une valeur unique plus significative.

La compréhension des bases de données vous aidera à progresser dans une entreprise étant donné que les bases de données sont nécessaires pour toute organisation puisqu'elles servent à communiquer les informations facilement et efficacement.",,,,

Containerized Applications on AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/containerized-applications-on-aws,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,"Morgan Willis, Russell Sayers","This course introduces you to container technologies and how they can be used to modernize your applications, as well as exploring how different AWS services can be used to manage and orchestrate those containers.

Container technologies have existed for years, and are still gaining popularity. Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?

AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.

This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",5607.0,46423.0,4.7,49.0

Create Docker Container with Flask Seaborn Regression Plot App,https://www.coursera.org/learn/create-docker-container-seaborn-regression-plot-app,Information Technology,Support and Operations,David Dalsveen,"Often a software application developed on one platform will not run on another because of software environment differences. Sometimes it can happen when an operating system is updated, for example. Suddenly an application starts to fail. Containers solve that problem by creating a controlled environment in which to run the application, separate from the host machine’s environment. The container contains a specific version of each software package that is known to work with an application at a given point in time. Docker is an application that allows the developer to generate containers to easily build and share applications.

In this course, you will create a Docker container in which you will implement a web application using flask in a Linux environment. The application will return a regression plot of data housed in a CSV file on the server.

Create Fault Tolerant MongoDB Cluster,https://www.coursera.org/learn/create-fault-tolerant-mongodb-cluster,Information Technology,Data Management,David Dalsveen,"In this course, you will create a MongoDB replica set on a single Linux server to become familiar with the setup. There will be three servers, one primary server and two secondary servers. You will then populate the database collection from a csv file using the Mongo shell. You will then retrieve data from the collection to verify the data. Finally, one of the servers will be taken down and you will observe that the data is still available through a new primary server.

Database Replication is an important aspect of Data Management. By keeping copies of a database on multiple servers, it allows continuous access to data when a database server goes down. Each replica database server should be kept on a separate physical server. This ensures that if one entire physical server become unavailable for some reason, the other database servers can still be accessed. MongoDB includes the means to handle replica in a straight-forward manner. There is one primary database server through which an application may connect to the database. Any time a write occurs to the primary server, the secondary servers are updated with the new data. When the primary server goes down, one of the secondary servers takes over as the primary server. There is a minimum of three servers required for a replica set.

Create User Directory and Files with Linux Commands,https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-directory-files-linux-commands,Information Technology,Support and Operations,David Dalsveen,"Practically everything on a Linux operating system is a directory or file. It is important to understand how the file system is structured and how to manipulate it from the command line. This allows for file management even when no GUI tools are present, which is common in a server environment. For example, in an organization it is important for new users to share a common directory and file setup to improve productivity. A system admin can add the new user and create the directory structure common to all other users in the system. The user can then customize their Linux experience by adding their own files and directories.

In this course, you will use Linux commands to create directories and files for a new user added to the system. The result will be a script to add a new user with a common directory structure.

NoSQL is an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases sacrifice some relational databases characteristics, such as a well-defined structure and strict relations between entities, in order to achieve better and easier scaling and replication, to handle large quantities of data, while being more generally flexible, cheaper and easier to manage. Instead of using tables, rows and columns, NoSQL document databases such as MongoDB use collections, documents and fields, represented with the well known JSON format.

Creating Database Tables with SQL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/creating-database-tables-with-sql,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will experience the process of defining, creating, and managing relational database tables using the SQL language. Tables are used as the containers for the data in a database. As such, the structure, or makeup, of each table in a relational database is critical, since it must be designed and created specifically to meet the needs of the data it will contain. The table’s structure indicates which pieces of data are stored in a table, as well as the type and size of each piece of data. 

Throughout the course, you’ll be exposed to guidelines and rules that database designers use to make sure that the tables will keep the data as safe and accurate as possible. You’ll learn to use SQL code to incorporate the constraints that help the database management enforce those rules. As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  Tables that are well-designed and created correctly improve data integrity--and make data retrieval easier!

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Coordination Research and Innovation Action under Grant Agreement No. 826497.

The course ""Cybersecurity in Healthcare"" has been developed to raise awareness and understanding the role of cybersecurity in healthcare (e.g., hospitals, care centres, clinics, other medical or social care institutions and service organisations) and the challenges that surround it. In this course, we will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. We look at both social aspects as technical aspects that come into play. Furthermore, we offer helpful resources that cover different aspects of cybersecurity. Even if you are not active in the healthcare domain, you will find helpful tips and insights to deal with cybersecurity challenges within any other organisation or in personal contexts as well.

This course begins by introducing the opportunities and challenges that digitalisation of healthcare services has created. It explains how the rise of technologies and proliferation of (medical) data has become an attractive target to cybercriminals, which is essential in understanding  why  adequate cybersecurity measures are critical within the healthcare environment. In later modules, course contents cover the threats, both inside and outside of healthcare organisations like e.g. social engineering and hacking. Module 4 on Cyber Hygiene describes how to improve cybersecurity within healthcare organisations in practical ways.  Module 5 looks deeper into how organisational culture affects cybersecurity, the cybersecurity culture, focusing on the interaction between human behaviour and technology and how organisational factors can boost or diminish the level and attention to cybersecurity in healthcare.

Database Design and Diagramming in Dia,https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-design-and-diagramming-in-dia,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will be introduced to the process of designing a database. The old saying about a picture being worth a thousand words rings true in the database design process. Database designers document their designs using diagrams. To document your basic design, you will use a diagramming tool called “Dia”. You will review user requirements to identify the categories of data that will need to be included in the database, and then fill out those categories with details. You will also determine how the categories are logically related. Using Dia, you will document your logical database design using a standard database design diagram called an Entity Relationship Diagram. Generating the ERD is an important step in the database design process.

Incident Detection and Response,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-7,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 7: Incident Detection and Response

Welcome to course seven, Incident Detection and Response. Having an intruder inside your systems for months unnoticed by your systems, administrators, security specialists, and end-users is tantamount to giving the intruder, the keys to your business or organization. In many cases, organizations discover that they have been subjected to a data breach when they are told by others that their private data has been offered for sale on the dark web. Many leading voices within the security profession state that we all must do better to detect the intruders in our myths. Many people even say that detecting intruders should be the priority for security professionals. Ransomware attacks have become a big business involving not only large scale extortion attacks, but also the sell of ransomware attack tools and services, as well as the exploitation of any data ex-filtrated during the breach. Government officials and industry professionals worldwide have been raising their voices about this new and very troubling variant in the business model of advanced persistent threat or APT attackers. In this chapter, we'll focus on intrusion and incident detection. Many of the tools, techniques, technologies, and ideas, you'll see here have already been examined in previous chapters. This course brings them together and begins by discussing the central theme of detecting the intruder. Model one uses the concepts of precursors and indicators, the signals that give us advanced warning and a genuine alert about a risk event and the indicators of compromise concept which are those signals that we're certain can only mean a hostile agent has gained access. Module two will extend these ideas and concepts around the idea of what to do after you've discovered a possible intrusion, expanding your understanding of incident response. Module three continues with a deeper look at supporting forensic investigations. Forensics is an evidence-based process of logically and dispassionately reasoning about a situation or an event. It's your inner child, looking at something and asking questions. Then following each of those questions with more questions, letting the facts that you find frame and shape your growing understanding of what happened, how why and where, who did it and what impacts it may have. With these questions answered you can circle back to reviewing risk mitigation controls to see which if any, need to be modified, replaced or augmented.

So, there are assembly lines and industrial aspects that needs to take into consideration when talking about IoT when used in an industrial scale. 

The story we are going to tell is about an individual who is new to that industry and got hired by a company who is planning to adopt to Industry 4.0 standards in next 3 years, the company is already familiar with some AWS services and already uses it for some other projects, such as their website and other workloads, so it makes sense for them to explore IIoT capabilities on AWS as well. 

The company got into a multi-year partnership with AWS to help them transform and innovate, the company is also hiring lots of people with IoT and Cloud background, preferably with industrial exposure. As today, the company hired Engineers and Architects, but they have limited industrial experience. The company plans to up-skill their existing workforce of industrial engineers with Cloud knowledge to expand their resource pool over time, and due to this workforce, there is a clear knowledge gap on how to build an edge to cloud continuum from factories to cloud today.

Malware Analysis and Introduction to Assembly Language,https://www.coursera.org/learn/malware-analysis-and-assembly,Information Technology,Security,IBM Security Learning Services,"Malicious software, or malware, is typically delivered over a network and is designed to cause disruption to a computer, client, server, or network. Disruptions can include leaked private information, unauthorized access to information or systems, blocked user access, interference with security and privacy, or numerous other variations of attacking systems.

Malware analysis dissects malware to gather information about the malware functionality, how the system was compromised so that you can defend against future attacks. 

Assembly is a low-level language that is used to communicate with the machine. Assembly programming is writing human-readable machine codes or machine instructions that are directly read by the computer. All high-level languages compiled programs like C or C++ can be broken down, analyzed, and understood using Assembly language with the help of a debugger. This process is known as reverse engineering.  Understanding what an executable program does is easy if you have direct access to the source code. But if not, such as the case with malware, learning Assembly can be helpful.

In this course, through video demonstrations, hands-on reverse engineering, and capture-the-flag type activities, you will be introduced to the processes and methods for conducting malware analysis of different file types. You will analyze native executable files, and analyze popular files like PowerShell, JavaScripts, and Microsoft Office documents.

Then you will learn the fundamentals of Assembly language, basic Win32 Assembly programming concepts, and how Reverse Engineers use Assembly to analyze malware.",,9365.0,,
Manage Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-azure-blob-storage-lifecycle,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Goran Kliček,"In Azure Blob Storage, you pay for the storage that blobs take up and the tier that they are stored in.

This tiered system is great and works well when you actively move your blobs to the appropriate tiers. Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management makes this easier by automatically moving blobs or deleting them based on rules.
 
In this beginner-level guided project ""Manage Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle”, you will create a resource group and set up a storage account, you will learn how to manually transfer blobs to different tiers, and eventually how to move them automatically and thus make the process easier.

Manipulating Data with SQL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manipulating-data-with-sql,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You’ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database. 

When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It’s much the same with designing and building database tables—the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.

As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You’ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you’ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike. 

In addition to adding data to the tables, you’ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL’s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.

Maturing Risk Management,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-8,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 8: Maturing Risk Management

In management science terms, maturing a process or practice means taking positive steps over time to make it more reliable, repeatable and efficient. In practice, this means getting better every day, while showing the measurements that demonstrate improvement and suggest other opportunities to improve. As we saw in chapters one and two risk management for information intensive organizations works best when using evidence-based reasoning to identify, characterize, and take actions as necessary to resolve the issues. Course eight will bring together numerous threads that are intrinsically related to managing the risks associated with information systems. Also, we know that cyber attack is a risk for all organizations. In this course, we will focus on bringing these ideas together in a context of continuous maturity modeling, measuring and monitoring. Risk alignment works best at the strategic long-term level of planning. By contrast risk maturation can be most effective when considered in day-to-day business operations. This is sometimes called operationalizing one's approach to risk management and maturation. Operationalizing risk management asks us to take the life cycle models about systems, software and data and connect or pivot them around business operations. We'll take on the view of the workers who use the business logic and the systems or the people who oversee the robotics and internet of things on the factory or warehouse floor and see how each of the different security disciplines brings something to them. This course has five modules. Module one focuses on change management and reveals how this detailed administratively intense process plays a primary role in protecting information systems. We'll also look at its vital contributions to incident response and remediation. Module two shows how physical security design principles are used to monitor and control the flow of physical objects in and out of various security zones. This module also considers the operational effects of safety planning and preparation on people and property, as well as availability and integrity of systems and information. Module three provides a different attitude and mindset about empowering and enabling the people in the organization to become more effective contributors and proponents of its information security. Security training programs have failed to help people complete their job safely and securely. New concepts such as micro chaining demonstrates that security education and awareness can add value to the security process. Module four shows us that system security assessment should be an ongoing task. Security has always involved continuous vigilance and integrity. Formal and informal audits demonstrate just how effective an organization's security controls are. As its process of maturing those controls continues to improve their performance. Module five brings many of these ideas and concepts together through business continuity and disaster recovery planning. The emphasis will be the operational support of these tasks, both in the planning and execution stages. We've prepared the foundations so you can bring concepts covered thus far into a cohesive daily operational context.

Process Data with Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Cosmo DB,https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-data-with-microsoft-azure-synapse-link-for-cosmo-db,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Brendan McKeown,"In the past, performing traditional analytical workloads with Azure Cosmos DB has been a challenge. ETL mechanisms to migrate data from Cosmos DB to platforms more suited to performing analytics on data exist, but are a challenge to develop and maintain.
Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB addresses the needs to perform analytics over our transactional data without impacting our transactional workloads. 
This is made possible through the Azure Cosmos DB Analytical store, which allows us to sync our transactional data into an isolated column store without us having to develop and manage complex ETL jobs, providing us with near real-time analytical capability on our data. In this project we will step through the process of configuring the services and process data using the Microsoft Azure Synapse Link for Cosmo DB.

Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-table-sql-queries,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you’ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language. 

We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts’   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you’re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It’s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That’s called “data retrieval”. 

Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as “the language of relational databases”. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper. 

You’ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio. 

Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it’s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you’ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!

Retrieve Data with Multiple-Table SQL Queries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multiple-table-sql-queries,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will be introduced to two methods of writing SQL queries that retrieve data from two or more tables. Since one of the functions of a database is to store data in an organized format, many databases are made up of multiple tables. Often, the data output required from the database is made up of data from more than one table. For example, the data that populates a student transcript might come from the Student, Course, and Section tables. While the Student table may provide the student’s name, the name and number of the course might come from the Course table and the specific grade for that course may come from yet another table. While writing SQL queries in SQLiteStudio, you'll learn the SQL syntax required to join tables together as you develop an understanding of how the relationships among tables come into play.

"Securing Software, Data and End Points",https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-4,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 4: Securing Software, Data and End Points

Welcome to Course Four. As we know, most attacks against systems involve exploiting vulnerabilities in software that powers hardware. Additionally, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware, especially when that hardware is for the protected against being stolen or accessed with unauthorized use, but their real target and all the tax is data. Therefore, it's so critical, the total set of software powering an organization's business logic and processes must be kept secure. As we'll see in this chapter, the software provides a layered environment. Building from a core or kernel of trustworthy functions up through to the mobile code and executable content. This enables and empowers all web apps and remote data access. Security professionals need to appreciate securing software covers two very different, but closely related major tasks. They need to ensure that the Security Posture of that software is known and understood, as well as ensure the software is installed, maintained, and used in ways consistent with Security Posture or improve it over time. As we discussed in the previous chapter, Security Posture is the set of risks, vulnerabilities controls, and residual risks pertaining to an asset or system. We summarize the safety or risk of using an asset and the degree of reliance that can be placed on the results from a specific context or situation.  In this course, we'll build on that foundation by looking more closely at how the data can be the target of an attack and part of exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system. We'll explore what security professionals, as non-programmers, can do to reduce the risk of such malformed input attacks. In course two, we also discussed the non-human user concept as a general way to view management and security of devices and software entities to protect those entities from threats to their integrity and to protect the overall system and individual assets from unauthorized behavior by those non-human users. In this chapter, we'll build on those concepts, as we dive into Endpoint Security Issues and Approaches.

Two Major Models of running containers in AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/two-major-models-of-running-containers-in-aws,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Ann Kovattil,"Welcome to this Project about “Two Major Models of running Containers in AWS”. This Project will be focusing on one of the many types of computing in AWS, called “Container Computing”. To understand the benefits of AWS Products and services, which relates to Containers, you need to understand what ‘Containers’ are and what benefits ‘Container Computing’ Provides. In this Project, you are going to get a chance to make a ‘Container’. 
If you are looking to deploy applications across multiple machines and platforms, Containers and virtual machines (VMs) are two of the top approaches in use today. Both can help your IT team become more agile and responsive to business demands. Both are used to host applications. Before containers came along, the “virtual machine” was the technology of choice for optimizing server capacity, but Virtual Machines had some drawbacks.
I f you run a virtual machine, say with 4 GB RAM and 4 GB disk, the operating system can easily consume 60 - 70% of the disk and much of the available memory, leaving relatively little for application which run in those Virtual Machine. But Containerization handles things in a different way. Instead of running a whole ‘operating System’ for each application, containers run as a process. So if you could run 5 applications using ‘Virtualization’, you will be able to run 15 applications using ‘Containerization’. 

This Project will help you to learn different ways of running “containers” in AWS. There are two different ways to run “containers” in AWS. One is using “EC2 instance” and other using “ECS Fargate”.So this Project has two major parts. In the first part, you will learn to create a docker image and test that image by running on a container, and once you verified your docker image works, you are going to upload it to “DockerHub”, which is a popular online resource for uploading docker images for others to access, either public or specific private individuals.In the second part of this project, you will learn to create an ECS cluster with Fargate cluster mode, and will deploy the container we created, into Fargate Cluster. So you are going to get some practical experience of how to deploy real container into a Fargate Cluster.

There is a lot to get through though. so let’s get started!!
Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",,,,

Use Power Automate & SharePoint to Automate Invoice Sending,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-power-automate-sharepoint-automate-invoice-sending,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Each company must produce invoices for their services and each invoice must be delivered to the client. Most companies have employees who are doing both tasks manually, first they create an invoice and then they send it by email to the customer. As with most other repetitive tasks, we can use Power Automate and SharePoint to automate one of those 2 tasks and that is, sending invoices by email. We just need to set up some rules, set up a SharePoint site as our data source and implement a Power Automate flow which will handle the process.

In this 40-minutes long guided project, “Use Power Automate & SharePoint to Automate Invoice Sending”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, set up a document library and create a Power Automate flow which will automate the sending of invoices to the customers. Of course, you can allow other colleagues to access and use this SharePoint site so they will be able to use your implementation as well. In the end, you won’t need to send emails to the customers manually, all you will have to do is create an invoice, name it correctly and upload it to the SharePoint document library and the Power Automate flow will do the rest. 

Since this project uses Office 365 services like SharePoint and Power Apps (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.",,,,
Use Process Advisor to Analyze and Automate Manual Process,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-process-advisor-analyze-automate-manual-process,Information Technology,Cloud Computing,Daniel Gregurić,"Imagine working in a car rental company that manually tracks which cars are rented out and which ones are ready for rental. As employees, we are responsible for informing all other employees about available cars each day and we are performing a repetitive process each day: we have to open SharePoint, find a site and Excel file, download the file, open it in Excel, filter out available cars, export it as PDF and send it by email to other colleagues who are responsible for car rentals, so they know which cars can be offered to the customers. Of course, this process is time consuming, and we don’t know which part of that process can be automated or how to automate it.

Thankfully, with Power Automate Process Advisor, not only can we see where the bottlenecks are and what can be automated, but we can also get a recommendation for which actions a Power Automate flow could be used for achieving the wanted automatization of this business process. With that, we can easily give machines to handle the repetitive process and spend our time on other business tasks. So, from 7 manual steps which must be done each day, we will end up with only 1 manual step, triggering the flow which we will create. How cool is that? 
 
This Guided Project "" Use Process Advisor to Analyze and Automate Manual Process"" is for any business professional who is looking to automate any kind of manual business process. In the project you will create a SharePoint site and a list (from a sample Excel file), and learn how to use Power Automate Process Advisor to analyze the manual process. You will also create a flow with the guidance of the Process Advisor analysis result. What’s great about SharePoint and Power Automate is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background!

Since this project uses Office 365 services (SharePoint, Excel, Outlook) and Power Automate (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.

معالجة الملفات والمجلدات بإستخدام Linux لمهندسي الكمبيوتر,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manipulate-files-and-folders-with-linux-for-it-engineers,Information Technology,Support and Operations,Abdelrahman Tarek Hafez,"في نهاية هذا المشروع ، ستكون قادرًا على التفاعل مع أوامر Linux ، ومعرفة المسار الذي تعمل فيه وتغييره إلى أي مسار آخر عن طريق تطبيق بعض الأوامر الأساسية مثل cd و pwd. ايضا  ، ستتمكن من اظهار الfolders والfiles  وإنشاؤها وحذفها عبر نظام Linux الخاص بك. أخيرًا ، ستتمكن من تطبيق تقنيات مختلفة لمعالجة الملفات والمجلدات من خلال إنشائها وقراءتها ونقلها باستخدام أوامر touch وcp و mkdir و rm وأخيراً ستكون قادرًا على استخدام أوامر SED و AWK. يعتبر الterminal أكثر قوة ومرونة ومفيدًا في إنشاء عمليات قابلة للتكرار. كما أنه أقل استهلاكًا للموارد لأنه عندما تعمل مع موارد محدودة أو ترغب ببساطة في زيادة سرعتك ، فإن استخدام ال terminal سيكون دائمًا أفضل من استخدام ال graphical user interface  لأن استخدام ال graphical user interface  يعني أنه يجب تخصيص الموارد اكبر لـ تقديم ال graphical input .

-هذا المشروع الإرشادي مخصص للأشخاص المهتمين بتعلم Linux من البداية.
-المبتدئين الذين يرغبون في استخدام أوامر Linux للمهام الأساسية ولكن لا يعرفون من أين يبدأون.
-المبتدئين الذين لا يعرفون كيفية استخدام الterminal.
-الأشخاص الذين يفكرون في مهنة كمسؤول أو مهندس لنظام Linux ، لكنهم بحاجة إلى الأساسيات أولاً.
