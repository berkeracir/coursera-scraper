Tetrault, Robert Krause, Elizabeth Roessler, Robert Heimer, Mary Lindsay Powell, Shannon Drew, Ellen Edens","This course is designed with a singular goal: to improve the care you provide to your patients with substance use disorders. By delving into a model case performed by actors, seven Yale instructors from various fields provide techniques to screen your patients for substance use disorder risk, diagnose patients to gauge the severity of their use, directly manage treatment plans, refer out to treatment services, and navigate the various conditions that may limit your patient’s access to treatment. You will ultimately be prepared to provide compassionate and evidence-based care to a large population of patients living with addiction— a chronic, often relapsing-remitting disease, but a treatable one.

How dangerous is COVID-19? Who is at risk of dying? All these questions are answered in Video 3. And finally how is this disease best treated and how can we slow the spread of the infection? These questions are answered in video 4.  In addition to the videos multiple choice questions are included to test your understanding and there is an epidemiology peer reviewed exercise designed to teach you how this infection is spread and to show the power of the tracing of cases and isolating those who are infected.

Prehospital care of acute stroke and patient selection for endovascular treatment using the RACE scale,https://www.coursera.org/learn/acute-stroke-race-scale,Health,Patient Care,"Montse Gorchs Molist, Natalia Perez de la Ossa, Frances Xavier Jiménez Fabregas","Acute stroke is a time-dependent medical emergency. In acute ischemic stroke, the first objective is to restore brain flow using sistemic thrombolytic treatment and, in patients with large vessel occlusion, by endovascular treatment. In hemorrhagic stroke there are also specific treatments that can improve the clinical outcome.

The sooner the initiation of all these therapies the higher the clinical benefit. Thus,  the organization of Stroke Code systems coordinated between emergency medical systems and hospitals is crucial to achieve early medical attention and treament.
Neurological scales facilitate stroke recognition at both hospital and pre-hospital levels and provide valuable information of stroke severity. The RACE scale is a prehospital scale validated as a tool to identify patients with suspected large vessel occlusion who are potential candidates for endovascular treatment. 

This course aims to update general knowledge in acute stroke and currently available treatments, to review the protocol
of the Stroke Code and, finally, to train in the use of the RACE scale.

To accomplish this, there will be videos from prior courses to review, links to the national registry patient care checklists, and you will use these resources to complete a series of patient care scenarios that challenge you to apply what you have learned over the past 5 courses.  

The next couple of weeks are designed to stretch your knowledge and guide you to apply it to potentially real patient presentations.  In addition, you will have the opportunity to practice peer review on the care plans that your fellow learners put together.  Not only does this provide you the opportunity to see what other people would do in a similar situation but also reinforces your understanding of the material.

There are four major objectives to the course;

1. Describe the prevalence, personal impact, and health care dilemma associated with chronic pain.
2. Recognize the clinical characteristics and underlying etiology of several common pain conditions and the peripheral, central, and genetic mechanisms of chronic pain
3. Based on the literature associated with risk and protective factors in the seven realms of our lives, learn specific strategies in each realm that can be employed daily to prevent chronic pain and enhance wellness.
4. Appreciate the value of a human systems approach to health care and how it can provide a basis for integrative, interdisciplinary, and individualized care to preventing pain and enhancing wellness.

Illnesses can increase stress as patients and families learn to live with a “new normal” that may often focus on illness. You’ll learn how to tell when normal sadness (or grief) becomes something more serious and needs to be addressed. People with serious illnesses also have social concerns as their family, friends and community support system becomes stretched, and sometimes fails. We’ll talk about resources and skills you can use to help support patients and families. You’ll learn about advance care planning, that includes shared decision-making, setting goals of care, and writing down plans for care.",3260.0,2011.0,4.9,82.0

With the current surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.

Course Audience
 - all health professions learners, example:
 - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,
 - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,
 - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners
 - as well as any and all health professionals interested in veteran-centered care

What You Will Learn:
This course will provide learners the opportunity to engage with material to facilitate their understanding of the origins of Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Administration affiliations, recognize and manage the influence of bias, class, and power on the clinical encounter and self-reflect on their biases that particularly affect U.S. military veterans.

Stanford's Short Course on Breastfeeding,https://www.coursera.org/learn/breastfeeding,Health,Patient Care,"Maya Adam, MD","Stanford's Short Course on Breastfeeding was designed for new mothers and the people who support them. This engaging, one-week learning experience, provides participants with everything they need to know to more successfully establish breastfeeding – or support a new mother who has decided to breastfeed. We created the course because we recognize that there is a very small window in which successful, exclusive breastfeeding can be established, and that many new mothers are mastering this skill during a busy and sometimes stressful time. Brought to life by beautiful illustrations and interviews with international mothers, we hope to reach the broadest spectrum of mothers, helping them understand the current recommendations, challenges, benefits and practical considerations around breastfeeding -  while simultaneously inspiring them to consider breastfeeding as the first choice for feeding their babies.

Learn how clinical patient-based questions related to immunizations, cancer screenings, or diabetes care can generate data to support a strategy of identifying non-utilization patterns. In the summative assignment, you will demonstrate your knowledge by explaining and synthesizing the importance of office-based processes and patient-based supporting functions to improve patient outcomes and experience as well as clinical quality. As you reflect on what you have learned in this course, you will also have an opportunity to consider the relationship between managing these processes and functions and the fundamental premise of value-based care.",,5190.0,4.7,32.0
Value-Based Care: Quality Improvement in Organizations,https://www.coursera.org/learn/value-based-care-quality-improvement-in-organizations,Health,Patient Care,"Susie Gronseth, Sara G. McNeil","COURSE 6 of 7. Fragmented healthcare has created the need for healthcare reform, changing how healthcare is delivered and managed by shifting the structure and culture of healthcare organizations across the U.S. In this course, you will explore ways that provider organizations can successfully move from volume to value through implementing Quality Improvement plans and Continuous Quality Improvement. Organizational improvement is a continuous process. To be successful means coming to grips with things you have to do, how they get done, and who needs to be involved. Paramount to the process is recognizing that every role—every team member—in the organization is important to a successful VBC strategy. You will also learn about adaptive leadership and how to advance vision and innovation through collaboration. Collaborative relationships between team members and leadership are critical to the transformation. You will explore strategies to gain buy-in, agreement, and understanding about the organization’s vision of value-based care and learn to engage team members in developing solutions to challenges. In the summative assignment, you will identify a measurable value-based care goal that would benefit from process improvement, describe how that goal will be communicated with the care team, and explain your role in leading the targeted improvements.",,2610.0,4.8,15.0

Voice Disorders: What Patients and Professionals Need to Know,https://www.coursera.org/learn/voice-disorders,Health,Patient Care,"Mark S. Courey, MD","Welcome to Voice Disorders: What Patients and Professionals Need to Know

Knowledge regarding vocal production physiology and management options for voice disorders have experienced rapid growth over the past 40 years.  This growth has resulted in a knowledge gap amongst patients and practitioners. Entirely new subspecialties of laryngology under otolaryngology and vocology under speech-language pathology have developed in response to this gap.

This MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is designed to educated patients, allied healthcare providers, vocal trainers/coaches, general medical practitioners and otolaryngologists.  Participants will be exposed to current concepts on the physiology of voice production.  These physiologic principles will be applied to speaking and performance voice production styles. Building on the knowledge of efficient voice production methods, participants will learn how vocal inefficiencies can lead to the development of voice disorders.  Finally, behavioral, medical and surgical management options and indications will be presented.

The course has been divided into five modules, each of which is followed by multiple choice questions: 

Week 1 - CME Information, Accreditation and Introduction (2 min)
Week 2 - Module 1: Basic Anatomy and Physiology of the Speaking and Singing Voice (29 min. + quiz) 
Week 3 - Module 2: Applied Physiology (Function) (20 min. + quiz) 
Week 4 - Module 3: Changes in Vocal Effort and Quality (20 min. + quiz) 
Week 5 - Module 4: Principles of Voice Evaluation and Examination (17 min. + quiz)
Week 6 - Module 5: Medical or Surgical Intervention (33 min. + quiz)

What is Palliative Care?,https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-palliative-care,Health,Patient Care,"Regina Fink, Maurice Scott, Kelly Arora, Amos Bailey, Nancy Robertson","Palliative care provides invaluable help for patients living with serious or life-limiting illness and their family caregivers.  Palliative care should be part of healthcare services to improve quality of life, the ability to tolerate and benefit from treatment and improve survival. In this course, you will learn about the nature of suffering and how this concept can help you understand the experience of people living with serious illness. Next, you will learn skills to more effectively communicate with patients, families and other care providers to both understand their experiences and provide an extra layer of support. In the next module you will explore your own core values and beliefs and how they impact your work with others. Finally, you will learn how to do a whole person assessment to understand the needs of people with serious illness so you can develop a plan to support them. 

You will be able to immediately use these insights, skills and tools in your work with people living with serious illness. In later courses, you will learn to ease pain and other symptoms, such as loss of appetite, shortness of breath and fatigue. In the final course, you will explore ways to ease psycho-social-spiritual distress. These courses will prepare you to bring basic palliative care to all in need.",7295.0,4412.0,4.8,258.0
ÉCHELLE RACE: Dépistage préhospitalier de l’AVC impliquant une occlusion de gros vaisseaux cérébraux,https://www.coursera.org/learn/prestorace-fr,Health,Patient Care,"Montse Gorchs Molist, Natalia Perez de la Ossa, Frances Xavier Jiménez Fabregas","L'AVC est une urgence médicale qui dépend du temps. Dans l'AVC ischémique, le type d'AVC le plus courant, le premier objectif est de rétablir la circulation cérébrale par un traitement thrombolytique avec rTPA intraveineux et, s'il n'est pas efficace ou s'il existe des contre-indications médicales, par traitement endovasculaire. Dans l'AVC hémorragique, il existe également des traitements spécifiques qui peuvent améliorer son pronostic. 

L'avantage de toutes les thérapies disponibles dans l'AVC aigu est d'autant plus grand que le traitement est commencé tôt. C'est pourquoi l'organisation de systèmes Code Ictus coordonnés entre les systèmes d'urgence médicale et les hôpitaux est cruciale pour obtenir le meilleur traitement possible des patients victimes d'un AVC aigu de manière rapide.

De plus, les échelles d'évaluation neurologique facilitent la reconnaissance de l'AVC aux niveaux hospitalier et préhospitalier et fournissent de précieux renseignements sur la gravité de l'AVC. En ce sens, l'échelle RACE est une échelle préhospitalière validée comme outil d'identification des patients ayant subi l'AVC le plus grave, dont on soupçonne une occlusion vasculaire, candidats à un traitement endovasculaire.
