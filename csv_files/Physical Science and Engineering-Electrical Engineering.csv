By the end of this course you should feel comfortable using free and open-source software to design your own printed circuit board and any bracketry or case to hold it, customized for your application.

Module 1 covers circuit simulation using several open-source projects and simulation methods for simulating transient response of circuits as well as frequency-domain response of filters. Additionally, we'll use open-source filter synthesis tools to help you quickly design and simulation filters.

Module 2 is all about creating professional looking electrical schematics. This is both an art and a skill and we'll cover the technical elements of using schematic entry software as well as broad concepts that are portable to any commercial application.

Module 3 takes our schematic and turns it into a physical PCB design. Understanding this process of how the schematic and the PCB layout work together is critical. We'll be demonstrating this with open-source software, but again, the concepts apply to any commercial software you may have access to.

Module 4 demonstrates the powerful idea of co-designing your electrical and mechanical systems together.

Digital images and videos are everywhere these days – in thousands of scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission.

A few examples are accelerators for radiotherapy which are the largest application of accelerators, altogether with more than 11000 accelerators worldwide. These accelerators range from very compact electron linear accelerators with a length of only about 1 m to large carbon ion synchrotrons with a circumference of more than 50 m and a huge rotating carbon ion gantry with a weight of 600 tons! 

There are also a growing number of synchrotron light sources in the world. The light in these sources are created by electrons that are accelerated to almost the speed of light. This light can reveal the molecular structures of materials and also take x-ray pictures of the inner structure of objects. Synchrotron light sources are very important in life sciences, material sciences and chemistry. Another type of accelerators are used in spallation sources, like the European Spallation Source in Lund, Sweden. Here protons are accelerated to very large energies. They produce neutrons when they are smashed into a disc of tungsten. These neutrons are used for finding the inner structure of objects and atomic structures of materials. Finally there are many accelerators for basic physics, like the large hadron collider in Cern.

This course takes you on a journey through the technologies used in particle accelerators: The microwave system which produce the electromagnetic waves that accelerate particles; The magnet technology for the magnets that guide and focus the beam of particles;  The monitoring systems that determine the quality of the beam of particles; Finally the vacuum systems that create ultra high vacuum so that the accelerated particles do not collide with molecules and atoms. Exciting right!

The course is graded through quizzes, one for each of the four modules. Throughout the course there are also a number of training quizzes to offer you support. The four modules in the course are: RF-systems, Magnet technology, Beam diagnostics, and Vacuum techniques.

Solar and wind raise specific challenges for the grid, and these challenges will have to be tackled if we want to deploy larger amounts of renewable sources. 

The aim of this lecture is to introduce these challenges and some approaches considered to overcome them. We are convinced that everyone involved in this journey, from investors, to entrepreneur, policy makers or simple customer should be aware of these issues if we want to make sure they don’t become a bottleneck limiting further development of renewable sources.",,2113.0,4.7,15.0

Silicon Thin Film Solar Cells,https://www.coursera.org/learn/silicon-thin-film-solar-cells,Physical Science and Engineering,Electrical Engineering,"Pr. Bernard Drevillon, Erik Johnson","This course consists of a general presentation of solar cells based on silicon thin films. 

It is the third MOOC of the photovoltaic series of Ecole polytechnique on Coursera. The general aspects of the photovoltaic field are treated in ""Photovoltaic Solar Energy"". And the detailed description of the crystalline silicon solar cells can be found in ""Physics of Silicon Solar Cells"".

After a brief presentation of solar cells operation, thin film semiconductors are described here. The general properties of disordered and crystalline semiconductors are found very different, in particular in terms of band structure and doping mechanisms. Silicon thin films, generally less than 1 µm thick, are deposited from silane plasma leading to hydrogen incorporation. The growth mechanisms are discussed, in particular the capability to prepare partially crystallized thin films which appear as a mixture of nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous tissue.

The consequences of the semiconductor properties on solar cells behavior are reviewed. The optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon are complementary. Thus the plasma process is particularly well adapted to the preparation of multijunctions, with conversion efficiencies around 13-15 %. Furthermore plasma processes allow to prepare solar cells in large area on glass or flexible substrates.

Finally, it is shown that crystalline and amorphous silicon materials can be combine into heterojunctions solar cells with high efficiency conversion (about 25 %).

This is Course #2 in the Modeling and Control of Power Electronics course sequence. The course is focused on techniques of design-oriented analysis that allow you to quickly gain insights into models of switching power converters and to translate these insights into practical converter designs. The design-oriented techniques covered are the Extra Element Theorem and the N-Extra Element Theorem (N-EET). Through practical examples, it is shown how the EET can be used to simplify circuit analysis, to examine the effects of initially unmodeled components, and to design damping of converters such as SEPIC and Cuk to achieve high-performance closed-loop controls. The N-EET will allow you to perform circuit analysis and to derive circuit responses with minimum algebra. Modeling and design examples are supported by design-oriented MATLAB script and Spice simulations. After completion of this course, the student will gain analytical skills applicable to the design of high-performance closed-loop controlled switching power converters.

Using Sensors With Your Raspberry Pi,https://www.coursera.org/learn/using-sensors-with-your-raspberry-pi,Physical Science and Engineering,Electrical Engineering,Drew Wilson,"This course on integrating sensors with your Raspberry Pi is course 3 of a Coursera Specialization and can be taken separately or as part of the specialization. Although some material and explanations from the prior two courses are used, this course largely assumes no prior experience with sensors or data processing other than ideas about your own projects and an interest in building projects with sensors. 

This course focuses on core concepts and techniques in designing and integrating any sensor, rather than overly specific examples to copy. This method allows you to use these concepts in your projects to build highly customized sensors for your applications. 

Some of the ideas covered include calibrating sensors and the trade-offs between different mathematical methods of storing and applying calibration curves to your sensors. We also discuss accuracy, precision, and how to understand uncertainty in your measurements. We study methods of interfacing analog sensors with your Raspberry Pi (or other platform) with amplifiers and the theory and technique involved in reducing noise with spectral filters. Lastly, we borrow from the fields of data science, statistics, and digital signal processing, to post-process our data in Python.",,,,
