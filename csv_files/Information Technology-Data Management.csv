Advanced Features with Relational Database Tables Using SQLiteStudio,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-features-relational-database-table-sqlitestudio,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course, you’ll increase your knowledge of and experience with relational tables as you explore alternative ways of getting data into tables. You’ll also look at some of the advanced features that can give relational tables super powers.  As you learn about the new features, you’ll use SQLiteStudio to apply them to your tables. Those features will enable your tables to more efficiently manage data—while keeping your data safe and accurate.  

Tables are great for data storage. The concept of organizing data in rows and columns is familiar to most people. Accountants use spreadsheets to organize financial data, making it easier to budget and track expenses. Parents use lists with columns to track their family’s schedules so that everyone gets to participate in outside activities. Even the Internal Revenue Service gets in the game by using tax tables to provide tax amounts for a variety of incomes. Even a simple grocery list is tabular in nature. Each row is an item, with one column having the item's name/description, and a second column noting the quantity needed. It’s no surprise that database designers like to use tables in a relational database to organize and store data. In the Design and Create a Relational Database Table Using SQLiteStudio course you learned about tables. You created and populated a relational table using the SQLiteStudio database management system. That was a great beginning.  Now it's time for the next step!",3143.0,,4.7,104.0

Cognitive Solutions and RPA Analytics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cognitive-solutions-rpa-analytics,Information Technology,Data Management,"Automation Anywhere, Inc.","Millions of companies in the world today are processing endless documents in various formats. Although Robotic Process Automation (RPA) thrives in almost every industry and is growing fast, it works well only with structured data sources.

What about the data that’s not fully structured and comes in varying layouts? To address this problem, there is another aspect of RPA that is taking the industry by storm: cognitive automation. 

While implementing RPA, you can deploy automations with “cognitive” capabilities. Cognitive automation uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn and understand the same way the human brain works. Thus, it assists humans in making decisions, completing tasks, or meeting goals. Using cognitive automation, you can extract semi—or unstructured data—which is 80% of all data!

Data is a precious asset. Businesses struggle to make sense of large volumes of available data and to generate a tangible value from them. Manual business processes barely contain any data that is available for capture. This is where Robotic Process Automation (or RPA) Analytics comes in. RPA bots don’t just automate business processes; they also digitize them. They take the large volume of data and interpret it in near real-time to provide actionable information.

In this course, you will be introduced to cognitive automation, the role that AI plays in it, and Automation Anywhere’s cognitive solution, IQ Bot. You will also be introduced to RPA analytics and explore how Automation Anywhere’s Web Control Room and Bot Insight can provide this functionality. 

As you begin this course, you will learn the six steps to deploy cognitive automation. Next, you will explore the IQ Bot portal – Automation Anywhere’s web-based application for developing the cognitive IQ bots. You will then learn to use the portal by following the IQ Bot workflow. 

Next, you will learn how RPA analytics help interpret and improve automated business processes. You will see how Bot Insight functions as an RPA analytics platform. 

You will also explore the different types of RPA analytics and learn how to generate RPA analytics via two mechanisms – the Web Control Room for Operational Analytics and Bot Insight for Business Analytics and CoE Analytics.

Finally, you will learn how to use the RPA mobile app to study and edit the default CoE dashboard that is published via Bot Insight.",3820.0,1880.0,4.4,26.0

Create Fault Tolerant MongoDB Cluster,https://www.coursera.org/learn/create-fault-tolerant-mongodb-cluster,Information Technology,Data Management,David Dalsveen,"In this course, you will create a MongoDB replica set on a single Linux server to become familiar with the setup. There will be three servers, one primary server and two secondary servers. You will then populate the database collection from a csv file using the Mongo shell. You will then retrieve data from the collection to verify the data. Finally, one of the servers will be taken down and you will observe that the data is still available through a new primary server.

Database Replication is an important aspect of Data Management. By keeping copies of a database on multiple servers, it allows continuous access to data when a database server goes down. Each replica database server should be kept on a separate physical server. This ensures that if one entire physical server become unavailable for some reason, the other database servers can still be accessed. MongoDB includes the means to handle replica in a straight-forward manner. There is one primary database server through which an application may connect to the database. Any time a write occurs to the primary server, the secondary servers are updated with the new data. When the primary server goes down, one of the secondary servers takes over as the primary server. There is a minimum of three servers required for a replica set.

Data is at the heart of all computing practices and plays an important role in our business and personal lives. Data is manipulated by programs, displayed on web browsers, transferred from location to location by networking systems, and used for business and personal decision making. Organizing, storing and safeguarding data in a database is the main purpose of database management software. Since data is such a large part of your life--whether used for your mobile phone address list or your medical record at your doctor’s office--wouldn’t it be great to know a little more about how a database works?

NoSQL is an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases sacrifice some relational databases characteristics, such as a well-defined structure and strict relations between entities, in order to achieve better and easier scaling and replication, to handle large quantities of data, while being more generally flexible, cheaper and easier to manage. Instead of using tables, rows and columns, NoSQL document databases such as MongoDB use collections, documents and fields, represented with the well known JSON format.

Creating Database Tables with SQL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/creating-database-tables-with-sql,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will experience the process of defining, creating, and managing relational database tables using the SQL language. Tables are used as the containers for the data in a database. As such, the structure, or makeup, of each table in a relational database is critical, since it must be designed and created specifically to meet the needs of the data it will contain. The table’s structure indicates which pieces of data are stored in a table, as well as the type and size of each piece of data. 

Throughout the course, you’ll be exposed to guidelines and rules that database designers use to make sure that the tables will keep the data as safe and accurate as possible. You’ll learn to use SQL code to incorporate the constraints that help the database management enforce those rules. As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.

Manipulating Data with SQL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manipulating-data-with-sql,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You’ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database. 

When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It’s much the same with designing and building database tables—the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.

As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You’ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you’ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike. 

In addition to adding data to the tables, you’ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL’s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.

Relational Database Design,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database-design,Information Technology,Data Management,Di Wu,"Have you ever wanted to build a database but don't know where to start? This course will provide you a step-by-step guidance. We are going to start from a raw idea to an implementable relational database. Getting on the path, practicing the real-life mini cases, you will be confident and comfortable with Relational Database Design. Let's get started!

Relational Database Design can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The MS-DS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer science, information science, mathematics, and statistics.

Relational Modeling in Dia,https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-modeling-in-dia,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will learn to interpret and draw a relational model through hands-on exercises using a diagramming tool called “Dia”. You will complete the final step in the database design process as you convert the logical design documented in an Entity Relationship Diagram into a Relational Model. During the conversion, you will investigate relational modeling rules and practice modeling techniques as you learn to resolve one-to-many and many-to-many relationships using foreign keys and bridge tables. Your final Relational Model will become the blueprint for creating a database and its tables. Since data is at the center of any information system, knowledge and understanding of database design will serve you well as a database user or a database designer.

Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-table-sql-queries,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you’ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language. 

We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts’   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you’re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It’s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That’s called “data retrieval”. 

Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as “the language of relational databases”. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper. 

You’ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio. 

Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it’s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you’ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!

Retrieve Data with Multiple-Table SQL Queries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/multiple-table-sql-queries,Information Technology,Data Management,Judy Richardson,"In this course you will be introduced to two methods of writing SQL queries that retrieve data from two or more tables. Since one of the functions of a database is to store data in an organized format, many databases are made up of multiple tables. Often, the data output required from the database is made up of data from more than one table. For example, the data that populates a student transcript might come from the Student, Course, and Section tables. While the Student table may provide the student’s name, the name and number of the course might come from the Course table and the specific grade for that course may come from yet another table. While writing SQL queries in SQLiteStudio, you'll learn the SQL syntax required to join tables together as you develop an understanding of how the relationships among tables come into play.
