A Crash Course in Causality:  Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data,https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality,Data Science,Probability and Statistics,"Jason A. Roy, Ph.D. ","We have all heard the phrase “correlation does not equal causation.”  What, then, does equal causation?  This course aims to answer that question and more!  

Over a period of 5 weeks, you will learn how causal effects are defined, what assumptions about your data and models are necessary, and how to implement and interpret some popular statistical methods.  Learners will have the opportunity to apply these methods to example data in R (free statistical software environment).

At the end of the course, learners should be able to:
1.  Define causal effects using potential outcomes
2.  Describe the difference between association and causation
3.  Express assumptions with causal graphs
4.  Implement several types of causal inference methods (e.g. matching, instrumental variables, inverse probability of treatment weighting)
5.  Identify which causal assumptions are necessary for each type of statistical method

So join us.... and discover for yourself why modern statistical methods for estimating causal effects are indispensable in so many fields of study!",34265.0,45342.0,4.7,474.0

Do you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions with data analysis tools? Then Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you, as you learn how to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making.

* What do I learn?
When you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training exercises. 

* Do I need prior knowledge?
The course is suitable for (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in the Building Blocks module. If you are searching for a MOOC on econometrics of a more introductory nature that needs less background in mathematics, you may be interested in the Coursera course “Enjoyable Econometrics” that is also from Erasmus University Rotterdam.

* What literature can I consult to support my studies?
You can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources. Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press. The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in the Course Guide – Further Information – How can I continue my studies.

* Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?
Staff and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance. We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss topics and exercises.

* How will I get a certificate?
To gain the certificate of this course, you are asked to make six Test Exercises (one per module) and a Case Project. Further, you perform peer-reviewing activities of the work of three of your fellow learners of this MOOC. You gain the certificate if you pass all seven assignments.

Have a nice journey into the world of Econometrics!

Enjoyable Econometrics,https://www.coursera.org/learn/enjoyable-econometrics,Data Science,Probability and Statistics,Philip Hans Franses,"The goal of this MOOC is to show that econometric methods are often needed to answer questions. A question comes first, then data are to be collected, and then finally the model or method comes in. Depending on the data, however, it can happen that methods need to be adapted. For example, where we first look at two variables, later we may need to look at three or more. Or, when data are missing, what then do we do? And, if the data are counts, like the number of newspaper articles citing someone, then matters may change too. But these modifications always come last, and are considered only when relevant. 

An important motivation for me to make this MOOC is to emphasize that econometric models and methods can also be applied to more unconventional settings, which are typically settings where the practitioner has to collect his or her own data first. Such collection can be done by carefully combining existing databases, but also by holding surveys or running experiments. A byproduct of having to collect your own data is that this helps to choose amongst the potential methods and techniques that are around.

If you are searching for a MOOC on econometrics that treats (mathematical and statistical) methods of econometrics and their applications, you may be interested in the Coursera course “Econometrics: Methods and Applications” that is also from Erasmus University Rotterdam.",17744.0,10418.0,4.1,80.0

Power and Sample Size for Multilevel and Longitudinal Study Designs,https://www.coursera.org/learn/power-sample-size,Data Science,Probability and Statistics,Albert Ritzhaupt,"Power and Sample Size for Longitudinal and Multilevel Study Designs, a five-week, fully online course covers innovative, research-based power and sample size methods, and software for multilevel and longitudinal studies.  The power and sample size methods and software taught in this course can be used for any health-related, or more generally, social science-related (e.g., educational research) application.  All examples in the course videos are from real-world studies on behavioral and social science employing multilevel and longitudinal designs. The course philosophy is to focus on the conceptual knowledge to conduct power and sample size methods. The goal of the course is to teach and disseminate methods for accurate sample size choice, and ultimately, the creation of a power/sample size analysis for a relevant research study in your professional context. 

Power and sample size selection is one of the most important ethical questions researchers face. Interventional studies that are too large expose human volunteer research participants to possible, and needless, harm from research. Interventional studies that are too small will fail to reach their scientific objective, again bringing possible harm to research participants, without the possibility of concomitant gain from the increase in knowledge. For observational studies in which there are no possible harms to the participants, such as observational studies, proper power ensures good stewardship of both time and money.

Most National Institutes of Health (NIH) study sections will only fund a grant if the grantee has written a compelling and accurate power and sample size analysis. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education, also offers competitive grants requiring a compelling and accurate power and sample size analysis (Goal 3: Efficacy and Replication and Goal 4: Effectiveness/Scale-Up). 

At the end of the online course, learners will be able to: 
•	Use a framework and strategy for study planning 
•	Write study aims as testable hypotheses
•	Describe a longitudinal and multilevel study design
•	Write a statistical analysis plan 
•	Plan a sampling design for subgroups, e.g. racial and ethnic
•	Demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment
•	Describe expected missing data and dropout
•	Write a power and sample size analysis that is aligned with the planned statistical analysis

Statistical Inference,https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference,Data Science,Probability and Statistics,"Brian Caffo, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Jeff Leek, PhD","Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.",168238.0,55469.0,4.2,4377.0
