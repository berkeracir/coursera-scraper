Assessment for Learning,https://www.coursera.org/learn/assessmentforlearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.

"Cognición, Pensamiento y Lenguaje",https://www.coursera.org/learn/cognicion-pensamiento-y-lenguaje,Social Sciences,Education,"Luciana Bocazzi, Débora Burin","¿Qué es la psicología cognitiva? ¿Cómo estudia la mente? ¿Cómo funciona la mente cuando tenemos que llegar a una conclusión en un razonamiento, tomar una decisión, resolver un problema o asignar causas a un hecho? ¿Qué pasa en nuestra mente entre que tenemos una idea y la expresamos en una serie de sonidos o gráficos, llamados “letras”? ¿O a la inversa, entre que escuchamos sonidos o vemos unos gráficos y nos hacemos una idea mental del contenido?

Estas son algunas de las preguntas que podrás ir respondiendo a lo largo del recorrido de las tres semanas que te propone este curso de introducción al estudio de la cognición, el pensamiento y el lenguaje. 
Nuestro curso comienza con el estudio de los procesos psicológicos básicos y la perspectiva cognitiva. En la primera semana, focalizaremos en presentar el estudio de los procesos básicos en psicología: ¿qué hay en la mente y cómo funciona? En primer lugar, destacaremos el abordaje empírico a los procesos mentales. Luego, expondremos la perspectiva cognitiva: la mente como procesador de información. ¿Qué significa la analogía entre la mente y una computadora (y qué no)? Finalmente, delinearemos los principales abordajes de estudio que van dando forma a la psicología cognitiva.
En la segunda semana, nuestro tema principal será la memoria y el pensamiento. ¿Cómo funciona la mente cuando tenemos que llegar a una conclusión en un razonamiento, tomar una decisión, resolver un problema o asignar causas a un hecho? Para eso, en primer lugar, vamos a presentar un modelo de sistemas de memoria, cuál es su función, cuáles son sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan. Luego, vamos a abordar el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento. ¿Qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada? ¿Y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática? Finalmente, vamos a revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.
En la última semana, nos dedicaremos a estudiar qué sucede en la mente cuando hablamos o entendemos lenguaje. ¿Cómo es el procesamiento entre que tenemos una idea y la expresamos en una serie de sonidos o gráficos, llamados “letras”? ¿Y cómo es el procesamiento entre que escuchamos una serie de sonidos o vemos unos gráficos y nos hacemos una idea mental del contenido? En este módulo, plantearemos el campo de la psicolingüística y nos detendremos en los procesos de comprensión y producción. Al final veremos algunos procesos y estudios experimentales dentro de la comprensión del lenguaje.

Objetivos del curso:
• Comprender a la psicología de los procesos básicos como una disciplina científica.
• Entender la analogía entre la mente y una computadora, y qué es un modelo en términos de arquitectura funcional.
• Dar cuenta de las perspectivas que confluyen en la psicología cognitiva y su relevancia para ella: la psicología experimental, los modelos computacionales, la neuropsicología cognitiva, la neurociencia cognitiva.
• Comprender un modelo de sistemas de memoria: su papel en la cognición, sus formas de adquisición y recuperación, y el formato de información con el que operan.
• Entender el campo de estudio del pensamiento y el planteo de dos “sistemas” o modos de procesamiento dentro del pensamiento.
• Entender qué pasa cuando intentamos razonar de forma lenta y deliberada, y cuando pensamos de forma rápida y automática.
• Revisar algunos de los heurísticos, sesgos y errores en el pensamiento rápido.
• Comprender el planteo del lenguaje humano como un sistema formal estructurado y reglado en el origen del abordaje cognitivo en psicolingüística.
• Comprender el campo de estudio y abordaje de la psicolingüística cognitiva.
• Comprender algunos de los procesos intervinientes en la comprensión del lenguaje y algunos de los estudios experimentales sobre este.",2588.0,42927.0,4.7,81.0

Disability Inclusion in Education: Building Systems of Support,https://www.coursera.org/learn/disability-inclusion-education,Social Sciences,Education,Judith McKenzie,"Worldwide millions of children are not able to fully participate in schooling, and this is especially a problem for children with disabilities. In this course, we explore the support that teachers need in order to meet the needs of children with severe to profound hearing, visual and intellectual disabilities.  We consider how this can be done by talking with a range of experts (from teachers to activists) about inclusive education as well as sharing experiences of education. 

Inclusive education is only possible if teachers are supported and empowered to make the curriculum accessible to all learners. The topics in this course cover developing disability confidence and what exactly children with specific impairments need to be able to learn. This includes sharing specific classroom strategies and teaching activities for learners who are D/deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision or have a severe to profound intellectual disability. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with the impairment specific needs of learners with disabilities, and how to build systems of support for inclusive education.

Exercer son esprit critique à l’ère informationnelle,https://www.coursera.org/learn/esprit-critique,Social Sciences,Education,"Mireille Bétrancourt, Emmanuel Sander","Aujourd’hui, notamment du fait de l’essor des technologies, nous sommes en permanence assaillis par une multitude d'informations. Pourtant, beaucoup d’entre elles semblent peu fiables voire volontairement mensongères, comme les fake news. Ainsi, même si nous n’avons jamais été aussi bien informés qu’avec Internet et les réseaux sociaux, la société fait paradoxalement face à un phénomène de désinformation.

Comment exercer son esprit critique dans ce contexte et pour quels enjeux ? Pourquoi les fake news et les théories complotistes peuvent-elles nous apparaître séduisantes ?

Tout au long de ce cours constitué de vidéos, d’interventions d’expert-es et d’activités variées, vous allez appréhender le phénomène de désinformation, en comprendre les ressorts et les manières de le contrer. Une première étape du cours sera d’identifier les divers biais cognitifs qui nuisent au raisonnement critique et à les reconnaître dans vos propres jugements. Puis, vous analyserez la diffusion des fake news : comment circulent-elles ? Quels sont leurs impacts sur le plan individuel et collectif ? 

En termes de compétences vous apprendrez des stratégies pour reconnaître les fausses informations et trouver des sources fiables. Vous analyserez le mécanisme cognitif de flexibilité cognitive, et enfin, vous apprendrez des stratégies concrètes afin de développer votre vigilance informationnelle.",2611.0,10315.0,4.7,47.0
Expanding SEL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/expanding-sel,Social Sciences,Education,"Emily Claire Price, Ben Kirshner","Social and emotional learning, or SEL, programs have flourished in schools during the last decade.  In this course the instructors (Emily Price and Ben Kirshner) introduce and help you examine community based and youth-empowerment approaches to social and emotional learning.  Some of these approaches address the impact of social and political systems, such as immigration and structural racism, on children’s social and emotional experiences.

This course is a part of the 5-course Specialization “The Teacher and Social Emotional Learning (SEL)”. Interested in earning 3 university credits from the University of Colorado-Boulder for this specialization? If so check out ""How you can earn 3 university credits from the University of Colorado-Boulder for this specialization"" reading in the first module of this course for additional information.

We want to note that the courses in this Specialization were designed with a three-credit university course load in mind. As a participant you may notice a bit more reading content and a little less video/lecture content.

Facilitate Organized Online Dialogue with Considerit,https://www.coursera.org/learn/online-dialogue-considerit,Social Sciences,Education,Danilo Oliveira Vaz,"Why is it so hard to participate in fruitful online dialogues, especially with dozens or hundreds of participants? Why do we so easily get caught up on divisive topics and opinions, instead of building up on each other perspectives? One may argue that the tools often used for such discussions (i.e., social media) are, by design, biased toward polarizing discourse. 

Therefore, this project presents Considerit, a digital tool for ""civil, organized, and efficient online dialogue"". While participating in and creating a forum on Considerit you will experience its capacity to handle nuances of complex discussions, as well as for visually summarizing what a community thinks about a specific statement, and why.

Formadores de Ciudadanía,https://www.coursera.org/learn/formadores-ciudadania,Social Sciences,Education,"Ana María Velásquez, Andrés Mejía, Enrique Chaux, Tatiana Mosquera","Gracias por acompañarnos en el curso Formadores de Ciudadanía. Este curso desarrolla y fortalece sus capacidades para formar, en la escuela, a ciudadanos que actúen de manera constructiva en una sociedad democrática, particularmente en tres ámbitos de la ciudadanía: la convivencia pacífica, la participación democrática y la valoración de las diferencias.

Si está interesado en aportar a la construcción de una sociedad pacífica, democrática e incluyente a través de la educación, este es el lugar donde puede aprender herramientas pedagógicas primordiales para cumplir esa misión. Si bien el curso presenta ideas que pueden ser útiles para actores educativos en general, los ejemplos y estrategias están particularmente dirigidos a docentes de contextos escolares.

Teniendo en cuenta que formar para el ejercicio activo, crítico y constructivo de la ciudadanía es una necesidad prioritaria en los contextos actuales, el curso presenta los temas, asuntos, problemas y conceptos indispensables para promover el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanas de niños, niñas y jóvenes en formación. Para lograrlo se propone analizar la ciudadanía a través de la ampliación progresiva de sus contextos de aplicación: el individual, el interpersonal, el grupal, el comunitario y el mundial.

Adicionalmente a estas comprensiones conceptuales, el curso ofrece la oportunidad de desarrollar capacidades didácticas en los participantes, quienes podrán diseñar estrategias pedagógicas orientadas al desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas de sus educandos y a la construcción de ambientes democráticos de aprendizaje que favorezcan dicho desarrollo.

Las actividades propuestas en el curso están diseñadas de tal forma que los participantes puedan apropiarse de herramientas conceptuales y pedagógicas a partir del principio de “aprender haciendo”, en donde permanentemente estarán poniendo en práctica dichos aprendizajes. Este es un curso ampliamente flexible que permite a los participantes escoger diferentes rutas de aprendizaje para concentrarse en los contenidos de su interés y/o en el nivel de profundización que quieren alcanzar para cada uno de ellos. Es así como el curso permitirá, especialmente a docentes escolares, desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades que les permitan educar para la ciudadanía, formando ciudadanos activos y críticos, que respeten la diferencia, que conozcan y hagan uso de los mecanismos de participación para la transformación de sus comunidades y que resuelvan pacífica y constructivamente los conflictos y retos que les plantea la sociedad en su rol como ciudadanos de su vida, de su comunidad y del mundo.

El diseño de este curso fue realizado en el marco de la segunda fase del SREDECC (Sistema Regional de Evaluación y Desarrollo de Competencias Ciudadanas), un escenario latinoamericano de cooperación técnica, financiado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y operado por la Fundación Antonio Restrepo Barco.

The public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a context of pervasive uncertainty, heightened anxiety, and social isolation that overlaps with a critical time of your own learning and development. The COVID-19 pandemic also has exacerbated long-standing inequalities and disparities, and recent events in the United States have laid bare historical and current realities of racism and systemic oppression. These challenges make starting college complicated in unprecedented ways, compounded by the fact that our university settings are themselves complex and rapidly changing. These challenges also present unique opportunities for interdisciplinary and practical learning. 

This course aims to help you navigate this world and the new conditions for learning with knowledge and skill. We designed the course with participatory methods, which means that we asked students to take a key role as partners with faculty in designing the course content, structure, and learning experiences. Together, we sought to integrate faculty expertise with the perspectives and experiences of students to make the course material relevant to your life. 

In this class, we will explore perspectives on disease and society and on systemic racism and inequality with scholars in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities, education, communications and media, and engineering. Engaging these disciplines to examine the complex problems of the global pandemic and systemic racism will help you build conceptual and practical skills that you will use throughout college and beyond.  

In conjunction with investigating health and social crises, new and ongoing, we also will explore the science and practice of individual and community wellness. You will learn skills relevant to emotions, relationships, common mental health concerns, and learning in the age of Zoom and remote classes. You will learn practices of cooperation, compassion, and anti-racism for community wellness.

La escuela y su comunidad: lecciones desde la ruralidad,https://www.coursera.org/learn/escuela-comunidad-lecciones-innovacion-educativa,Social Sciences,Education,"Valeria Schildknecht, Tomás Montemerlo, Darío José Verón, Álvaro de Ávila Aguilar, Marisa Inés Zallocco, Alejandra Salvagiot","La comunidad de una escuela es mucho más que sus docentes, alumnos y padres; abarca al contexto en el que está inserta y a los actores que la rodean. Una escuela abierta a la comunidad se enriquece y, a la vez, enriquece a quienes la rodean. Las escuelas de contextos rurales tienen un gran camino recorrido en la relación con la comunidad y muchos aprendizajes valiosos para compartir con escuelas de todas las modalidades. 

Este curso te servirá para analizar y comprender las particularidades de los vínculos entre una escuela y su comunidad. A su vez, podrás identificar distintas posibilidades de involucrar a la comunidad en la escuela para potenciar la tarea educativa. Te ofrecerá un marco para el análisis de propuestas institucionales que incluyan a la comunidad con el objetivo de mejorar los aprendizajes de los alumnos. También, te permitirá conocer casos concretos de escuelas abiertas a la comunidad e identificar los factores que les posibilitan alcanzar las metas que se proponen. 

El carácter práctico del curso hará que obtengas herramientas para analizar y proponer planes de intervención que incluyan redes de colaboración entre actores escolares y no escolares.

Spikes, Richard Hornik","Never before has the need for News Literacy been more urgent. As news consumers are bombarded with a constant stream of fake news, propaganda, hoaxes, rumors, satire, and advertising — that often masquerade as credible journalism — it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. While the public’s faith in the news media erodes, purveyors of misinformation have helped give rise to troubling cultural trends and alarming political movements.

This six-week course will help learners develop their critical thinking skills to enable them to better identify reliable information in news reports and to become better informed about the world in which we live. The course will discuss the key elements of journalism from the viewpoint of the news audience.

The language of instruction is English, but Chinese and Spanish subtitles will be available. Each week will tackle a challenge unique to the digital era:

Week 1: The power of information is now in the hands of consumers.
Week 2: What makes journalism different from other types of information?
Week 3: Where can we find trustworthy information?
Week 4: How to tell what’s fair and what’s biased.

This competency-based, skill-building course will help non-U.S. students, first-generation immigrants, and foreign-born professionals better understand and master American online learning, as well as other U.S. virtual environments, for college and career success. In the post-COVID era, the course can also be very instrumental in assisting U.S.-based institutions in organizing remote learning activities for their current or prospective international students. 

The current pandemic has disrupted the world of higher education and work as we know it. Many thousands of international students and professionals can no longer travel internationally at will and must now learn how to effectively study and work remotely. To excel in American online learning and work environments, international students and foreign-born professionals need to know how American universities and companies use the Internet to organize study and work, develop and execute projects, communicate ideas, collaborate, and solve organizational and technical problems. By taking this course, you will learn how to enhance your cultural knowledge and assess potential skill gaps that may hinder your online experience or negatively impact your performance in U.S. virtual learning and work environments. Throughout the course you will systematically review competencies required for online work, come to better understand common barriers for non-native students and professionals, learn how to detect and overcome competency gaps, and develop plans for self-improvement and success.

Multilevel Modeling,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlm,Social Sciences,Education,Erasmus Graduate School of Social Sciences and the Humanities Team,"In this course, PhD candidates will get an introduction into the theory of multilevel modelling, focusing on two level multilevel models with a 'continuous' response variable. In addition, participants will learn how to run basic two-level model in R. 

The objective of this course is to get participants acquainted with multilevel models. These models are often used for the analysis of ‘hierarchical’ data, in which observations are nested within higher level units (e.g. repeated measures nested within individuals, or pupils nested within schools).  In this type of data causes of outcomes (e.g. the performance of pupils in schools) are located both at the level of the individual (e.g., own and parental resources), and at a higher, contextual, level shared by some of the individuals (e.g. characteristics of the class and of the teacher). Because of this, the assumption of 'independent observations' is violated with hierarchical data, but multilevel modelling can easily account for that. Moreover, multilevel modelling can easily deal with missing data (in most circumstances).

Negotiating Learner Differences: Towards Productive Diversity in Learning,https://www.coursera.org/learn/learnerdifferences,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","An investigation of the dimensions of learner diversity: material (class, locale), corporeal (age, race, sex and sexuality, and physical and mental characteristics) and symbolic (culture, language, gender, family, affinity and persona). Examines social-cultural theories of difference, as well as considering alternative responses to these differences in educational settings - ranging from broad, institutional responses to specific pedagogical responses within classes of students. The course also focuses on the application of learning technologies and new media to meet the needs of diverse populations of learners. Its main practical question is, how do we use educational technologies to create learning environments in which learning experiences can be customized and calibrated to meet the precise needs of particular learners? Topics include: universal design for learning, differentiated instruction systems, and adaptive and personalized learning environments.

New Learning: Principles and Patterns of Pedagogy,https://www.coursera.org/learn/newlearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","Education is in a state of flux – transitioning from traditional architectures and practices to new ecologies of teaching and learning influenced by the tremendous social and technological changes of our times. What changes are afoot today in workplaces, civic life and everyday community life? What are their implications for education? What are the possible impacts of contemporary social transformations on teaching and learning - including in the areas of technology, media, globalization, diversity, changing forms of work in the “knowledge society”, and, in these contexts, changing learner needs and sensibilities? This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: “didactic”, “authentic” and “transformative” learning. It takes an historical perspective in order to define the contemporary dimensions of what we term “new learning”. It prepares participants to make purposeful choices and link particular theories/instructional approaches to individual and group learning goals.

En este curso, desde la perspectiva de las psicologías del condicionamiento, vamos a explorar cómo nuestros cuerpos aprenden a regular sus respuestas fisiológicas a partir de los estímulos del ambiente (condicionamiento clásico) y cómo nuestras conductas aumentan, disminuyen y se transforman en hábitos o adicciones a partir de sus consecuencias (condicionamiento operante). Desde la perspectiva de la psicología cognitiva, vamos a explorar cómo se adquieren habilidades, cómo usamos estrategias, incorporamos datos y asimilamos conceptos (aprendizajes procedimentales y declarativos) y cómo nuestros valores y creencias acerca del mundo se adquieren de las personas que nos acompañan en la vida (aprendizaje cognitivo social). Finalmente, desde la perspectiva de la psicología humanista, vamos a ver cómo el aprendizaje más significativo, el más apasionado y transformador, surge de la conexión con nuestra propia integridad y de un modo de vincularnos con otros que tiene la capacidad de potenciarnos (aprendizaje centrado en el alumno).

Resilient Teaching Through Times of Crisis and Change,https://www.coursera.org/learn/resilient-teaching-through-times-of-crisis,Social Sciences,Education,"Rebecca Quintana, PhD","Resilient teaching is the ability to facilitate learning experiences that are designed to be adaptable to fluctuating conditions and disruptions. This teaching ability can be seen as an outcome of a design approach that attends to the relationship between learning goals and activities, and the environments they are situated in. Resilient teaching approaches take into account how a dynamic learning context may require new forms of interactions between teachers, students, content, and tools. Additionally, they necessitate the capacity to rethink the design of learning experiences based on a nuanced understanding of context. 

The course is designed with higher education faculty, lecturers, and graduate student instructors in mind, but may also be applicable to educators in a wide variety of instructional environments. The course is aimed at participants who may be asked to rethink how they teach in the immediate or near future due to the ever-changing circumstances of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the creation of this course is motivated by the current crisis, we expect it will remain relevant to instructors who are faced with disruptions and change to their teaching for any number of reasons and must quickly adapt their course designs.

To support learning and reflection, we are introducing a new journaling tool within the course that provides a place for participants to reflect on their own experiences. To support community growth, participants can choose to share their journal entries with the wider course community in an interactive gallery space.",5529.0,4531.0,4.8,53.0
"Responding, Revising and Assessing Student Writings",https://www.coursera.org/learn/responding-revising-assessing-student-writings,Social Sciences,Education,Mark Farrington,"When writers write, readers respond. Responding to student writing gives teachers one of the most meaningful avenues to help students learn and grow. In this module, learners will identify best practices in effectively responding to student writing. You will also define revision, identify how revision differs from editing, and examine strategies for teaching students how to engage in effective revision. Finally, because writing can also be used for testing, and because all students learn in increments over time, learners will identify a number of strategies for evaluating and assessing student writing, both for individual writings and a student writer’s progress over a period of time. Learners will also consider ways to involve students in both the responding and assessment processes. At the conclusion of this course, learners will have a toolbox full of strategies and practices for these three significant components of any writing class: responding to, revising and assessing student writing.",,2715.0,,

Teaching Writing Process,https://www.coursera.org/learn/teaching-writing-process,Social Sciences,Education,Mark Farrington,"Half a century ago, a revolution took place in the teaching of writing. Educators asked, “What if we were to study how professional writers wrote, as a way to learn how we might teach writing more effectively?” The result was the writing process movement, with its emphasis on not just writing as product but as process. Good writing doesn’t magically appear, nor does it spring from the brain fully formed and perfect the first time. Instead, all writers engage in a process, and while that process can vary writer to writer, some stages do seem to apply, in some way, to almost every writing situation. This course demonstrates how teaching writing as process can lead to a significant increase in students’ comfort level and confidence as writers. Learners will examine methods for teaching writing as discovery, and for using low-stakes writing and reflection in their classes.

We’ll use insights from movie-making—not to mention from odd visual tricks in Barb’s kitchen—to see how students learn, both independently and together. We all know, for example, that social learning is valuable in helping students grapple with tough concepts as well as in making learning more fun. But if you understand what is happening in the brain during social learning, you can also understand why certain approaches commonly used in online learning, such as discussion forums, can sometimes pose a challenge.  As you will see, we can use insights from neuroscience not only to motivate our students, but to help them change their very identity.  

Our course is designed for university professors,  vocational instructors, K-12 teachers, coaches, business trainers, parents, and in fact, anyone who is trying to teach concepts or skills online. We're not just talking about traditional academic materials—if you’ve ever considered teaching a course on Udemy, putting up a video series on YouTube, or launching your own educational blog, this course is also for you. An essential and exciting point is that students can learn even BETTER online than they can in the traditional face-to-face classroom. That’s whether you’re teaching synchronously—that is, live, via a platform like Zoom; or you’re teaching asynchronously—that is, any time—by having videos and other teaching materials accessible to students whenever they want. 

You can take this course independently from the other two ""Uncommon Sense Teaching"" courses in this specialization—some of the neuroscience- and cognitive-psychology-based insights we’ll mention here in simple ways are explored more deeply in those other courses. So feel free to take the other two courses in the specialization in conjunction with or after this course. If you’ve already taken the other two courses, you’ll find that this course reviews and extends the practical insights from neuroscience you’ve already received in unexpected new directions. And you’ll find even deeper insights we haven’t covered before.

In TEACHING ONLINE you'll be joining a trio of experienced online instructors who have taught millions in some of the world's most popular online courses.  One of our deepest goals for this course is to help YOU to teach others to improve their ability to reach and teach students. We’ve loaded the animations and visuals we've developed for this course online in PowerPoints (licensed under Creative Commons) in the assets under the videos, as well as in the resources section. You can rework these PowerPoints as you wish to reteach this material to your colleagues and students. Your sharing and resharing of this material is one of the best things you can do to help us all move teaching and learning forward to a visionary future.

Understanding child development: from synapse to society,https://www.coursera.org/learn/child-development,Social Sciences,Education,dr. Jorg Huijding,"In this course, we dive into the topic of child development. You will learn that child development is complex and is influenced by a surprisingly rich number of factors at many different levels of organization. You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.

In order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.

To illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University. These scientists will give a look in their field of knowledge and their collaboration with colleagues, to illustrate how the theory you will learn translates to practice.

Bienvenido al MOOC ""Usos Didácticos del Cine: Introducción al Análisis"", ofrecido por la UNAM. A lo largo de este curso, te presentaremos varias formas de usar películas en tus clases para mejorar el rendimiento de tus estudiantes. Además, podrás acceder a una variedad de herramientas y marcos conceptuales referentes a la teoría del cine válidos para poder usar con más conocimientos cualquier obra cinematográfica en el aula.

Comencemos con una pregunta: ¿Cómo puede hacer que una película haga que el proceso de enseñanza y aprendizaje sea más efectivo e interesante? Si te has registrado en este curso, probablemente quieras saberlo. Existen numerosas maneras de responder a esta pregunta y las cubriremos durante las próximas semanas. Esperamos que este curso te brinde formas emocionantes de incorporar la película a tu práctica profesional como docente, así como mostrarte otras dimensiones del arte cinematográfico de las que quizás no hayas sido consciente, con formas sencillas de explorarlas y explotarlas en tus lecciones.

Nuestros objetivos generales de aprendizaje para las siguientes semanas son:

•	Distinguirás algunos elementos básicos del análisis, la forma y el lenguaje cinematográfico a través de explicaciones y ejemplos para utilizarlos en una clase que emplee el cine como recurso didáctico.

•	Reconocerás las formas en que el cine de ficción o documental puede apoyar la enseñanza y el aprendizaje para la posterior selección de material audiovisual que contribuya en dichos procesos.  

•	Diseñarás materiales de aprendizaje efectivos y atractivos con cine mediante la elaboración de un plan de trabajo que permita tener un modelo a partir de las características que poseas de tu grupo.

Writing and Disseminating Grey Literature,https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-and-disseminating-grey-literature,Social Sciences,Education,"Rekha Raghunathan, Archita Suryanarayanan, Yashodara Udupa, Kaavya Pradeep Kumar, Shobita Rao","If you are a  researcher, academic, student, development sector professional or a practitioner who is keen to reach the research-based knowledge you have created to a wider audience, this course is for you.

Vast amounts of knowledge are produced by educational and research institutions through rigorous research and fieldwork. Yet, there is a dearth of access to this knowledge among non-academic communities (which includes practitioners, policymakers, and citizens) due to the language used. Researchers can bring visibility to grey literature if they engage with alternate public writing forms.

Newer platforms for knowledge dissemination across digital, print, and multimedia channels have made information from grey literature more available and accessible to lay readers. Using formats such as data stories, photo narratives, opinion pieces and infographics, these platforms can help researchers reach a much wider audience when they adopt newer writing techniques.

This course will:
* Provide an overview of data stories, photo narratives, opinion pieces and infographics produced from grey literature
* Teach methods to craft such pieces
* Explain how to pitch to media outlets
* Teach how social media can be leveraged to draw greater visibility to publications",,,,
e-Learning Ecologies: Innovative Approaches to Teaching and Learning for the Digital Age,https://www.coursera.org/learn/elearning,Social Sciences,Education,"Dr William Cope, Dr Mary Kalantzis","For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.

But what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?

This course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:

1. Ubiquitous Learning
2. Active Knowledge Making
3. Multimodal Meaning
4. Recursive Feedback
5. Collaborative Intelligence
6. Metacognition
7. Differentiated Learning

These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.

Take this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois
--------------------------------

This course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the Assessment for Learning course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.

Of course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement is good engagement.

On the other hand, if you would like to take this course for credit at the University of Illinois, you will find more information about our program here:
