Cloud and Wireless Security,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-6,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 6: Cloud and Wireless Security

Welcome to course six. This course applies to security concepts, ideas, and considerations to two major changes that we have experienced in recent years. It's regarding the way we use the data. First, we use our data on the go. In other words, data services are provided to our mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and other devices. Second, many enhanced functions are implemented through services hosted in the cloud platform, where our data is stored or processed. Both transformations are complex topics. However, as a security practitioner, we can narrow these two topics by applying the security fundamentals to secure the data. This boils down to the three basics of protecting data at rest, in motion, and in use. The data is either on the endpoint devices, servers, or other endpoints, making these services a reality. 

Course 6 Learning Objectives

After completing this course, the participant will be able to: 

L6.1 - Recall cloud security concepts and configurations.

Oomen","The Cybersecurity in Healthcare MOOC was developed as part the SecureHospitals.eu project. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Coordination Research and Innovation Action under Grant Agreement No. 826497.

The course ""Cybersecurity in Healthcare"" has been developed to raise awareness and understanding the role of cybersecurity in healthcare (e.g., hospitals, care centres, clinics, other medical or social care institutions and service organisations) and the challenges that surround it. In this course, we will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. We look at both social aspects as technical aspects that come into play. Furthermore, we offer helpful resources that cover different aspects of cybersecurity. Even if you are not active in the healthcare domain, you will find helpful tips and insights to deal with cybersecurity challenges within any other organisation or in personal contexts as well.

This course begins by introducing the opportunities and challenges that digitalisation of healthcare services has created. It explains how the rise of technologies and proliferation of (medical) data has become an attractive target to cybercriminals, which is essential in understanding  why  adequate cybersecurity measures are critical within the healthcare environment. In later modules, course contents cover the threats, both inside and outside of healthcare organisations like e.g. social engineering and hacking. Module 4 on Cyber Hygiene describes how to improve cybersecurity within healthcare organisations in practical ways.  Module 5 looks deeper into how organisational culture affects cybersecurity, the cybersecurity culture, focusing on the interaction between human behaviour and technology and how organisational factors can boost or diminish the level and attention to cybersecurity in healthcare.

Incident Detection and Response,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-7,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 7: Incident Detection and Response

Welcome to course seven, Incident Detection and Response. Having an intruder inside your systems for months unnoticed by your systems, administrators, security specialists, and end-users is tantamount to giving the intruder, the keys to your business or organization. In many cases, organizations discover that they have been subjected to a data breach when they are told by others that their private data has been offered for sale on the dark web. Many leading voices within the security profession state that we all must do better to detect the intruders in our myths. Many people even say that detecting intruders should be the priority for security professionals. Ransomware attacks have become a big business involving not only large scale extortion attacks, but also the sell of ransomware attack tools and services, as well as the exploitation of any data ex-filtrated during the breach. Government officials and industry professionals worldwide have been raising their voices about this new and very troubling variant in the business model of advanced persistent threat or APT attackers. In this chapter, we'll focus on intrusion and incident detection. Many of the tools, techniques, technologies, and ideas, you'll see here have already been examined in previous chapters. This course brings them together and begins by discussing the central theme of detecting the intruder. Model one uses the concepts of precursors and indicators, the signals that give us advanced warning and a genuine alert about a risk event and the indicators of compromise concept which are those signals that we're certain can only mean a hostile agent has gained access. Module two will extend these ideas and concepts around the idea of what to do after you've discovered a possible intrusion, expanding your understanding of incident response. Module three continues with a deeper look at supporting forensic investigations. Forensics is an evidence-based process of logically and dispassionately reasoning about a situation or an event. It's your inner child, looking at something and asking questions. Then following each of those questions with more questions, letting the facts that you find frame and shape your growing understanding of what happened, how why and where, who did it and what impacts it may have. With these questions answered you can circle back to reviewing risk mitigation controls to see which if any, need to be modified, replaced or augmented.

Malware Analysis and Introduction to Assembly Language,https://www.coursera.org/learn/malware-analysis-and-assembly,Information Technology,Security,IBM Security Learning Services,"Malicious software, or malware, is typically delivered over a network and is designed to cause disruption to a computer, client, server, or network. Disruptions can include leaked private information, unauthorized access to information or systems, blocked user access, interference with security and privacy, or numerous other variations of attacking systems.

Malware analysis dissects malware to gather information about the malware functionality, how the system was compromised so that you can defend against future attacks. 

Assembly is a low-level language that is used to communicate with the machine. Assembly programming is writing human-readable machine codes or machine instructions that are directly read by the computer. All high-level languages compiled programs like C or C++ can be broken down, analyzed, and understood using Assembly language with the help of a debugger. This process is known as reverse engineering.  Understanding what an executable program does is easy if you have direct access to the source code. But if not, such as the case with malware, learning Assembly can be helpful.

In this course, through video demonstrations, hands-on reverse engineering, and capture-the-flag type activities, you will be introduced to the processes and methods for conducting malware analysis of different file types. You will analyze native executable files, and analyze popular files like PowerShell, JavaScripts, and Microsoft Office documents.

Then you will learn the fundamentals of Assembly language, basic Win32 Assembly programming concepts, and how Reverse Engineers use Assembly to analyze malware.",,9365.0,,

Maturing Risk Management,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sscp-4th-ed-course-8,Information Technology,Security,(ISC)² Education & Training,"Course 8: Maturing Risk Management

In management science terms, maturing a process or practice means taking positive steps over time to make it more reliable, repeatable and efficient. In practice, this means getting better every day, while showing the measurements that demonstrate improvement and suggest other opportunities to improve. As we saw in chapters one and two risk management for information intensive organizations works best when using evidence-based reasoning to identify, characterize, and take actions as necessary to resolve the issues. Course eight will bring together numerous threads that are intrinsically related to managing the risks associated with information systems. Also, we know that cyber attack is a risk for all organizations. In this course, we will focus on bringing these ideas together in a context of continuous maturity modeling, measuring and monitoring. Risk alignment works best at the strategic long-term level of planning. By contrast risk maturation can be most effective when considered in day-to-day business operations. This is sometimes called operationalizing one's approach to risk management and maturation. Operationalizing risk management asks us to take the life cycle models about systems, software and data and connect or pivot them around business operations. We'll take on the view of the workers who use the business logic and the systems or the people who oversee the robotics and internet of things on the factory or warehouse floor and see how each of the different security disciplines brings something to them. This course has five modules. Module one focuses on change management and reveals how this detailed administratively intense process plays a primary role in protecting information systems. We'll also look at its vital contributions to incident response and remediation. Module two shows how physical security design principles are used to monitor and control the flow of physical objects in and out of various security zones. This module also considers the operational effects of safety planning and preparation on people and property, as well as availability and integrity of systems and information. Module three provides a different attitude and mindset about empowering and enabling the people in the organization to become more effective contributors and proponents of its information security. Security training programs have failed to help people complete their job safely and securely. New concepts such as micro chaining demonstrates that security education and awareness can add value to the security process. Module four shows us that system security assessment should be an ongoing task. Security has always involved continuous vigilance and integrity. Formal and informal audits demonstrate just how effective an organization's security controls are. As its process of maturing those controls continues to improve their performance. Module five brings many of these ideas and concepts together through business continuity and disaster recovery planning. The emphasis will be the operational support of these tasks, both in the planning and execution stages. We've prepared the foundations so you can bring concepts covered thus far into a cohesive daily operational context.

Welcome to Course Four. As we know, most attacks against systems involve exploiting vulnerabilities in software that powers hardware. Additionally, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware, especially when that hardware is for the protected against being stolen or accessed with unauthorized use, but their real target and all the tax is data. Therefore, it's so critical, the total set of software powering an organization's business logic and processes must be kept secure. As we'll see in this chapter, the software provides a layered environment. Building from a core or kernel of trustworthy functions up through to the mobile code and executable content. This enables and empowers all web apps and remote data access. Security professionals need to appreciate securing software covers two very different, but closely related major tasks. They need to ensure that the Security Posture of that software is known and understood, as well as ensure the software is installed, maintained, and used in ways consistent with Security Posture or improve it over time. As we discussed in the previous chapter, Security Posture is the set of risks, vulnerabilities controls, and residual risks pertaining to an asset or system. We summarize the safety or risk of using an asset and the degree of reliance that can be placed on the results from a specific context or situation.  In this course, we'll build on that foundation by looking more closely at how the data can be the target of an attack and part of exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system. We'll explore what security professionals, as non-programmers, can do to reduce the risk of such malformed input attacks. In course two, we also discussed the non-human user concept as a general way to view management and security of devices and software entities to protect those entities from threats to their integrity and to protect the overall system and individual assets from unauthorized behavior by those non-human users. In this chapter, we'll build on those concepts, as we dive into Endpoint Security Issues and Approaches.
