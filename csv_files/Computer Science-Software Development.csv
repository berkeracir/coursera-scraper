Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization,https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling,Computer Science,Software Development,"Prof. Peter James Stuckey, Prof. Jimmy Ho Man Lee","Optimization is a common form of decision making, and is ubiquitous in our society. Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions in manpower and material resources management also allow corporations to improve profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, all of these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.

This course is intended for students interested in tackling all facets of optimization applications. You will learn an entirely new way to think about solving these challenging problems by stating the problem in a state-of-the-art high level modeling language, and letting library constraint solving software do the rest. This will allow you to unlock the power of industrial solving technologies, which have been perfected over decades by hundreds of PhD researchers.  With access to this advanced technology, problems that are considered inconceivable to solve before will suddenly become easy.

In addition, Java is truly cross-platform, which means it can be compiled on a Windows system and executed on a Mac or Linux system. Java contains a built-in garbage collector that removes objects no longer needed in the application which reduces memory leak issues.

C++ Classes and Objects,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-classes-and-objects,Computer Science,Software Development,David Dalsveen,"In this project you will create an application that defines a Car class and create one to many Car objects using C++.

Object Oriented programming is advantageous because it allows the programmer to think in terms of the way people think of the real world, in terms of Objects like employees, airplanes, and homes for example. In procedural programming, the programmer tends to think more in terms of procedures or functions. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, Classes and Objects are often used interchangeably but there is a distinction between the two. A class is a blueprint for objects. An automobile may come in many different makes, colors, and models, but each car object has those same attributes. A Car class then contains the common attributes all cars have; color, make and model. When an Object of a Car is made from the Car class, it is then assigned a specific color, such as a red Nissan Sentra or a blue Toyota Camry.

The data is then uniquified in a Set data structure and stored in a Map for accessing data by year.

C++'s standard template library or STL contains data structures or containers that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as a Vector can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A List is like a Vector, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Map is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.

C++ Decision Programming,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cpp-decision-programming,Computer Science,Software Development,David Dalsveen,"In this project you will create an application that yields a zodiac sign based on an input of birth month and day.
The process of making decisions is fundamental in programming, just as it is in real life. A pre-existing condition is evaluated, and a decision is made based on the evaluation. For example, if it is cold outside, a person chooses to wear a coat. If a temperature sensor exceeds a certain threshold, the furnace turns off. In C++, as in other programming languages, a decision construct is used to control the sequence of instructions that are executed under certain conditions. It allows the programmer the power to take certain action based on various input conditions. For example, a grading program will need to assign a certain grade based on a test score.

A hallmark of Object-Oriented programming is code-reuse. Code re-use allows the developer to use tried and tested code, which results in more reliable code and saves in development time as well. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as C++, code re-use can be accomplished in two distinctive ways. One way is to inherit from an existing class by extending its existing functionality. Another common way to re-use code is through aggregation and composition. In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the child class. In composition, the child class depends on its parent for existence.

Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course covers the first half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). Our intent is to teach programming to those who need or want to learn it, in a scientific context. 

We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.

We use the Java programming language and teach basic skills for computational problem solving that are applicable in many modern computing environments. Proficiency in Java is a goal, but we focus on fundamental concepts in programming, not Java per se.

Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).

Why take this course?

•	It is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors. 
•	Java 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
•	Atomic variables and isolation
•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
•	Actor model in Java

Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads).",20759.0,25637.0,4.5,632.0

Fundamentos de TypeScript,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentos-ts,Computer Science,Software Development,"Rubby Casallas, Juan Pablo Reyes Gómez","JavaScript es un lenguaje desarrollado para ser utilizado principalmente en el desarrollo de aplicaciones web dinámicas. Más recientemente, también se ha popularizado como un lenguaje para desarrollar aplicaciones back-end utilizando node.js, que es un intérprete de JavaScript del lado del servidor. 

JavaScript es un lenguaje no tipado, de scripts y funcional. Los scripts se embeben en una página Web y las instrucciones de ese script las analiza y procesa (o interpreta) el navegador en el momento que deben ser ejecutadas. El hecho de que los programas escritos en JavaScript no se compilen tiene como consecuencia que muchos de los errores que puede cometer el programador, solo se van a detectar en tiempo de ejecución. Esto es más evidente con los errores relacionados con los tipos de datos, por ejemplo: valores incompatibles entre las variables cuando estas se operan; cambios de tipo en las variables; funciones con parámetros que no son recibidos; valores de retorno de las funciones que no son los esperados, entre otros. 

Una alternativa para solucionar estos problemas es TypeScript. Este es un lenguaje de programación, creado por Microsoft, que amplía JavaScript. El lenguaje se ha creado como un proyecto de código abierto, con licencia de Apache License 2.0, por lo que la comunidad de desarrolladores puede usarlo libremente. Entre sus características más notables, es que TypeScript brinda seguridad de tipos de datos a JavaScript. Esta característica permite a los desarrolladores ser muy efectivos e introducir menos errores gracias a que los programas escritos en TypeScript se compilan.

Introducción a Java,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduccion-java,Computer Science,Software Development,Elisa Viso Gurovich,"Me llamo Elisa Viso y una de mis pasiones es la de programar y enseñar a programar. 

El lenguaje Java es uno de los que más me ha gustado en mis 45 años que llevo programando. Si bien te podrá parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos básicos verás qué rápido se avanza.
Java, como todos los lenguajes de programación bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con más trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de cómo piensas la solución al problema). 
Pero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extraño, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como tú quieres y obtengas una satisfacción enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.

Este es un curso introductorio a la programación en Java. Como Java es un lenguaje orientado a objetos de propósito general, revisaremos los conceptos básicos del lenguaje como clases e interfaces. Veremos los ingredientes básicos de una clase como constantes y variables, funciones (métodos), y cómo organizar estos ingredientes dentro de una clase. También veremos la utilización de clases de las bibliotecas de Java.

En el primer módulo revisaremos el concepto de orientación a objetos aplicándolo en la vida real.

En el segundo módulo revisamos una herramienta de diseño orientado a objetos, llamada tarjetas de responsabilidades, y a partir de estas últimas diseñamos los encabezados de los distintos servicios que se van a dar, codificándolos en una interfaz.

En el tercer módulo terminaremos la construcción de la clase que corresponde a este problema, aclarando términos comunes en Java, revisando la sintaxis del lenguaje y la autodocumentación con la que cuenta.

En el cuarto módulo utilizaremos lo que ya tenemos para construir una clase más compleja que proporciones arreglos de objetos de la clase que ya tenemos y examinando con bastante profundidad tanto el esquema conceptual de los arreglos como su implementación en el modelo de memoria de Java.

En el quinto y último módulo profundizaremos en el uso de repetición en ejecución y, no puede faltar, los distintos tipos de ejecución condicional que provee el lenguaje.

En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, se proveerá al participante con conocimientos del lenguaje Java que le permitirán resolver una amplia gama de problemas con este lenguaje. Aprenderá a:
•	Plantear la solución de un problema utilizando orientación a objetos.
•	Programar la solución de los problemas utilizando las siguientes características del lenguaje Java:
               -Interfaces y clases
               -Métodos constructores de objetos, de acceso, de actualización, de implementación y auxiliares.
               -Atributos y variables locales de tipos primitivos o de clase.
               -Utilización de clases de biblioteca.
               -Esquemas de ejecución como la repetición y la selección de enunciados

Introduction to the Unity Input System,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-unity-input-system,Computer Science,Software Development,Edward Falzon ,"In this one-hour, project-based course, you'll learn how to install and configure the new Input System. Unlike the old system, called Input Manager, Unity's new system will allow developers to create bindings that map actions to input devices - eliminating the need to manage which input device a player is using, nor which physical button a player is pressing. In this project, you'll learn how to create ""control schemes"" and ""action maps"" and use them in your C# scripts to create device-agnostic player movement.

The guided project will introduce you to the following Unity concepts:
- New Input System
- Rigidbody
- C# coding techniques such as event-handling

This course makes use of the poly-castle Unity project created in Create Keyboard Movement Mechanics with C# in Unity. It compliments this guided project and, although not a prerequisite, is recommended for a more well-rounded understanding of the concepts presented herein. In this project, we will replace the project's existing input system with the new system.

Loops are used in a Java program whenever a sequence of code must be repeated. A common use for a while loop is to read data from a file, where the file is of unknown length. A for loop, on the other hand is often used when the repeat count of a code sequence is known. A common use of a for loop is to iterate through an array. An Array is a list of items of a fixed size where each entry is the same type of data. The array could contain numbers, Strings of characters, or a user-defined data type.

Java's collections framework contains data structures that are built for efficiency. They are used to store and retrieve data in various formats. A list such as an ArrayList can be used in place of an array to contain data where the size cannot be determined ahead of time. A LinkeList is like an ArrayList, except elements can be more quickly added and deleted from it, since no shifting needs to occur. A Hashmap is used to quickly look up a value based on a key rather than a numerical index, for example, to look up a phone number based on a key containing a person's name. A Set may be used to remove duplicates from a list, simply by assigning the data to it.

Code re-use allows the developer to use tried and tested code, which results in more reliable code and saves in development time as well. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as Java, code re-use can be accomplished in two distinctive ways. One way is to inherit from an existing class by extending its existing functionality. A Car class for example can be extended by a Used Car class by adding a parameter to indicate the number of miles on it. Another common way to re-use code is through aggregation and composition. In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the parent class.

Parallel Programming in Java,https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java,Computer Science,Software Development,Vivek Sarkar,"This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of parallel programming in the context of Java 8. Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile devices, while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism.

Why take this course?

•	All computers are multicore computers, so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism.
•	Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin, Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

•	Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
•	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
•	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
•	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
•	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks

Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of multicore Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other parallel programming systems that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., C++11, OpenMP, .Net Task Parallel Library).",39117.0,44580.0,4.6,1149.0

In part 2 of this course,  the programming portion of the class will focus on concepts such as recursion, assertions, and invariants. The mathematical portion of the class will focus on searching, sorting, and recursive data structures.  Upon completing this course, you will have a solid foundation in the principles of computation and programming.  This will prepare you for the next course in the specialization, which will begin to introduce a structured approach to developing and analyzing algorithms.  Developing such algorithmic thinking skills will be critical to writing large scale software and solving real world computational problems.",18032.0,15546.0,4.8,356.0

O objetivo deste curso é expor você às principais técnicas e princípios de desenvolvimento ágil, em especial aos que se popularizaram pela sua utilização no framework Scrum e na metodologia XP (Extreme Programming). Apresentamos o Scrum&XP, uma combinação apropriada do framework Scrum com a metodologia XP – Extreme Programming, sem no entanto afirmar que você estará aprendendo tudo sobre Scrum ou sobre XP.

Os conceitos apresentados neste curso incluem o seguinte:

* Manifesto ágil e princípios de desenvolvimento ágil

* Requisitos de software na forma de user stories e backlog de produto

* Eventos e reuniões do Scrum&XP: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Planning Poker, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review e Sprint Retrospective, TDD e Programação em Pares

* Papéis do Scrum: Product Owner, Time de Desenvolvedores e Scrum Master

* Tarefas, Sprint Backlog, Quadro de Tarefas e Diagrama Burndown

Ao final deste curso, você terá amadurecido de tal modo suas habilidades de programação que será capaz de implementar de modo ágil um sistema que incorpora um componente de gamificação constante do Trabalho de Conclusão do Programa de Cursos Integrados, com base nas boas práticas ágeis exercitadas neste curso com o Scrum&XP apresentado.

Obs.: Embora o Programa de Cursos Integrados (descrito abaixo) seja sobre a linguagem Java no contexto de desenvolvimento ágil, neste curso em especial você poderá empregar a linguagem que desejar, embora incentivemos que os alunos dos cursos anteriores do programa faça uso do Java, pois será uma oportunidade muito enriquecedora de praticar TDD com Java da maneira que se faz na indústria de software.

"Problem Solving, Python Programming, and Video Games",https://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games,Computer Science,Software Development,"Duane Szafron, Paul Lu","This course is an introduction to computer science and programming in Python.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1.  Take a new computational problem and develop a plan to solve it through problem understanding and decomposition.
2.  Follow a design creation process that includes specifications, algorithms, and testing.
3.  Code, test, and debug a program in Python, based on your design.

Important computer science concepts such as problem solving (computational thinking), problem decomposition, algorithms, abstraction, and software quality are emphasized throughout.  The Python programming language and video games are used to demonstrate computer science concepts in a concrete and fun manner.  However, a learner can take the knowledge and skills from this course and apply them to non-game problems, other programming languages, and other computer science courses.

You do not need any previous programming, Python, or video game experience.  However, some computer skills (e.g., mouse, keyboard, document editing), knowledge of algebra, attention to detail (as with many technical subjects), and a “just give it a try” spirit will be keys to your success.  Despite the use of video games for all the programming examples, PVG is not about computer games.  PVG will still provide valuable knowledge and skills for non-game computational problems.

The interactive learning objects (ILO) of the course provide automatic, context-specific guidance and feedback, like a virtual teaching assistant, as you develop problem descriptions, algorithms, and functional test plans.  The course forums will be supported by the creators of the course, to help you succeed.

All videos, assessments, and ILOs are available free of charge.  There is an optional certificate available for a fee.",51457.0,110460.0,4.3,184.0

The C programming language is the basis for many other programming languages. Its syntax has been used in languages such as C++, Java, and C# to name a few. These languages utilize pointers to access variables, so it is an important concept to grasp. C is still the language of choice for writing Operating systems, games, and many other applications where performance is critical.

Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-formal-modeling-1,Computer Science,Software Development,"Dr.ir. Pieter Cuijpers, Anne Remke","Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   

After finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.

Disclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.

This course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente).

Quantitative Model Checking,https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantitative-model-checking,Computer Science,Software Development,Anne Remke,"The integration of ICT (information and communications technology) in different applications is rapidly increasing in e.g. Embedded and Cyber physical systems, Communication protocols and Transportation systems. Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).

First, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. 

Model checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes
the functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.
The main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms. The learning objectives of this course are as follows:

- Express dependability properties for different kinds of transition systems .
- Compute the evolution over time for Markov chains.
- Check whether single states satisfy a certain formula and compute the satisfaction set for properties.",5656.0,2971.0,4.2,50.0

You'll learn how to set up a simple 2D environment similar to rooms from the original game; how to make the player move with the keyboard and enable the player to pick up and drop objects in the same way as Adventure!; and how to write a C# script that will reveal the Easter egg once all the requirements are met.

System Validation (2): Model process behaviour,https://www.coursera.org/learn/system-validation-behavior,Computer Science,Software Development,Jan Friso Groote,"System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. It is the next logical step in computer science and improving software development in general. It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly. We want to guarantee that the systems does exactly what it is supposed to do. The techniques put forward in system validation allow to prove the absence of errors. It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. This means that the systems are not only behaving correctly, but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ’Model process behaviour' is the follow up MOOC to 'Automata and behavioural equivalences'. This MOOC shows you how to model process behaviour, in particular protocols and distributed algorithms, dive deeper in the properties of system behaviour, and keep things simple to avoid a state space explosion.

Unordered Data Structures,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-3,Computer Science,Software Development,Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider,"The Unordered Data Structures course covers the data structures and algorithms needed to implement hash tables, disjoint sets and graphs. These fundamental data structures are useful for unordered data. For example, a hash table provides immediate access to data indexed by an arbitrary key value, that could be a number (such as a memory address for cached memory), a URL (such as for a web cache) or a dictionary. Graphs are used to represent relationships between items, and this course covers several different data structures for representing graphs and several different algorithms for traversing graphs, including finding the shortest route from one node to another node. These graph algorithms will also depend on another concept called disjoint sets, so this course will also cover its data structure and associated algorithms.",13486.0,22532.0,4.7,479.0

Use AI Builder and Power Apps to Process Invoice Data,https://www.coursera.org/learn/use-ai-builder-power-apps-process-invoice-data,Computer Science,Software Development,Daniel Gregurić,"What's the quickest and most efficient way of keeping track of incoming invoices? A company accounting department usually keeps data on business expenses in lists where employees manually enter invoice data such as invoice number, invoice date, due date, total amount etc. It's a time-consuming and error-prone process, but thankfully, it can be automated with AI Builder and Power Apps or Power Automate. 

In this 60-minutes long guided project, “Use AI Builder and Power Apps to Process Invoice Data”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, build and train AI Builder model for processing invoice data and create a Power Apps application which will use that model and AI builder to read data from invoices and save it to the created SharePoint list. Of course, that Power App application can be shared with colleagues so they can upload invoices from their devices or take a photo of them directly. All we need to do is take our phone, open the application, upload the document, or take a photo of the invoice and let the Power App and AI builder do the rest. Is that a great improvement of a business process or what? The best thing about SharePoint, AI Builder and Power Apps is that anyone can learn to use them regardless of their educational background. We don’t need to be familiar with any programming language, basic knowledge of Excel-like formulas is enough for completing this project.

Since this project uses Office 365 services like SharePoint and Power Apps (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.

Test Driven Development or TDD involves writing tests before the python application is implemented. Writing the test before implementing the code means the tests should fail when they are executed, which removes the likelihood of a test returning a false positive result. It also is another means of verifying the code specification, especially if the tests are written by a person or group outside of the core development team.
Finally, the tests may be executed every time a code modification occurs to keep the code base in check.

Version Control of a Python Project using Git,https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-of-a-python-project-using-git,Computer Science,Software Development,David Dalsveen,"Version Control Systems keep track of files by saving changes over time. For example, a developer can make changes to a file and check the file in to the system. The system will create a version for that file and any other files that were changed. If any subsequent changes are made later that prove to break the software, a previous working version of the software can be recalled. Git was developed to provide an efficient means of version control and was originally developed to track Linux Kernel development.

Version Control with Git,https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git,Computer Science,Software Development,Steve Byrnes,"The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. 

In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently ""know just enough Git to be dangerous"". 

There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)

You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. 

This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). 

This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.",102810.0,70851.0,4.7,2716.0
